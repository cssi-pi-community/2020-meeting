			<h2>2020 NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) Principal Investigator Meeting</h2>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<p class="tagline">Towards a National Cyberinfrastructure Ecosystem</p>
				<p>February 13-14, 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle, Washington</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			This NSF PI meeting aims at further building the community around the NSF CSSI and its precursor programs (DIBBs, SI2) toward a national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. The meeting provides a forum for PIs to share technical information about their projects with each other, NSF program directors and others; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and new collaborations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At least one representative (PI/Co-PI/senior personnel) from each active CSSI, SI2 and DIBBS project is required by NSF to attend the meeting and give a one-minute lightning talk and a poster presentation on their project. For a <u>collaborative project with multiple awards</u>, one representative from the entire project is required. Anyone who is interested in attending the meeting is welcome and encouraged to do so. There is no registration fee, but participants need to register by the deadline to allow for planning logistics such as space and food.
		</p>
		<p>
			This meeting venue is in close vicinity to and concurrently with the <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/pp20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (PP20)</a>. Attendees of PP20 are encouraged to join and interact with CSSI investigators and visit the poster sessions in the CSSI PI meeting.

									<p>The goal of this project is to provide the scientific community with easily accessible high-quality atomic data and user-friendly broadly-applicable modern relativistic code to treat electronic correlations. The code will be capable of calculating a very broad range of atomic properties to answer the significant needs of atomic, plasma, and astrophysics communities. We also propose a creation on an online portal for high-precision atomic physics data and computation that will provide a variety of services to address the needs of the widest possible community of users. The portal will contribute a novel element to today's U.S.  cyberinfrastructure ecosystem, improving usability and access for the atomic physics community and their fields of application.</p>

									<p>In developing investment priorities, the CSSI programs seeks to engage the capabilities, curiosity and creativity CI research community PIs. Ongoing feedback from and dialogue with PIs from the CI research community is therefore critical. Surveys are an efficient and effective mechanism for staying connected and collecting input. This session describes the methodology and results of a survey of principal investigators (PIs), co-PIs, and others the CI research community. The survey, which was carried out by the Nexight Group under the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) Award (#1930025), had two primary purposes. First, the survey was designed to inform decisions about changes to be made to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) solicitation. Second, the survey was designed to inform decisions about the future direction and focus of the NSF CSSI umbrella program. The survey results provide insights that enhance CSSI’s support of a cyberinfrastructure for scientific research.</p>

									<p>Reasoning about real-world social habitats often represented as  multiplexed co-evolving networks is complicated and scientifically challenging due to their size, co-evolutionary nature and the need for representing multiple dynamical processes simultaneously. The 2014 Ebola epidemic, 2009 financial crisis, global migration, societal impacts of natural and human initiated disasters and the effect of climate change provide examples of the many challenges faced when developing such environments.  Advances in computing has fundamentally altered how such networks can be synthesized, analyzed and reasoned.</p>
									<p>We will briefly describe our work on co-evolving socio-technical networks by drawing on our work in urban transport planning, national security and public health epidemiology to guide the discussion. We will conclude by describing an exciting new project funded by the NSF that aims to develop CINES: a scalable cyberinfrastructure for network science.  CINES builds on a prior NSF project, CINET and serve as a community resource for network science. CINES provide an extensible platform for producers and consumers of network science data, information, and software.</p>

									<p>Soil moisture is a critical variable that links climate dynamics with water and food security. It regulates land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., via evapotranspiration---the loss of water from evaporation and plant transpiration to the atmosphere), and it is directly linked with plant productivity and plant survival. The current availability in soil moisture data over large areas comes from remote sensing (i.e., satellites with radar sensors), which provides nearly global coverage of soil moisture at spatial resolution of tens of kilometers. Satellite soil moisture data has two main shortcomings. First, although satellites can provide daily global information, they are limited to coarse spatial resolution (at the multi-kilometer scale). Second, satellites are unable to measure soil moisture in areas of dense vegetation, snow cover, or extremely dry surfaces; this results in gaps in the data.</p>
									<p>In this talk, we will present how we address these two shortcomings with a modular SOil MOisture Spatial Inference Engine (SOMOSPIE). SOMOSPIE consists of modular components including input of available data at its native spatial resolution, selection of a geographic region of interest, prediction of missing values across the entire region of interest (i.e., gap-filling), analysis of generated predictions, and visualization of both predictions and analyses. To predict soil moisture, our engine leverages hydrologically meaningful terrain parameters (e.g., slope and topographic wetness index) calculated using an open source platforms for standard terrain analysis (i.e., SAGA-GIS or System for Automated GeoScientific Analysis-Geographical Information System) and a suite of machine learning methods. We will present empirical studies of the engine's functionality including an assessment of data processing and fine-grained predictions over United States ecological regions with a highly diverse soil moisture profile.</p>

									<p>Image registration is an inherently ill-posed problem that lacks a unique mapping between voxels of the two images being registered. As such, we must confine the registration to only physically meaningful transforms by regularizing it via an appropriate penalty term which can be calculated numerically or analytically. The numerical approach, however, is computationally expensive depending on the image size, and therefore analytical methods are preferable. Using cubic B-splines as the basis for registration, we develop a generalized mathematical framework that accommodates five distinct types of regularizers: diffusion, curvature, linear elastic, third-order, and total displacement. We validate our approach by testing the accuracy achieved by each of the regularizers against their numerical counterpart. We also provide benchmarking results showing that the analytic solutions run significantly faster --- up to two orders of magnitude --- than central-differencing based numerical solutions.<br /><br />As a case study, we show how to use deformable registration to improve the accuracy of the Multi-atlas based segmentation (MABS). The effect of various regularizers on MABS accuracy is compared using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics.</p>

									<p>Expanding opportunities for data-driven research and increasing requirements for data management in sponsored research have resulted in a growing need for retention of both long-term archival data sets that are infrequently accessed, as well as 'active archives' of data that are accessed periodically to revisit, revise, and share experimental results. For this project, the University of South Dakota acquired, deployed, and maintains the South Dakota Data Store (SDDS), a network-accessible, sharable, multi-campus storage resource integrated with existing campus cyberinfrastructure. SDDS supports twelve STEM projects across eight departments at four institutions in South Dakota, including 30 faculty, 43 postdocs, and 303 students. SDDS provides South Dakota researchers with a centralized, efficient, high-performance platform for both archival of and shared access to large quantities of electronic data.</p>

									<p>Cardiovascular (CV) simulations have become a crucial component of fundamental research in surgical planning, device design, diagnosis, and disease mechanisms. The project team has previously developed SimVascular (www.simvascular.org), which is currently the only open source software package providing a complete pipeline from medical image data segmentation to patient specific blood flow simulation and analysis in arteries and veins. The SimCardio open source project will extend and enhance the functionality of SimVascular to the realm of heart modeling, providing the first fully integrated computer model of cardiac physiology and function. This will help basic science and medical researchers perform computer modeling in numerous diseases affecting heart function in children and adults. This computer modeling software will enable researchers to build models of the heart and vascular anatomy directly from medical imaging data, which can be used for personalized treatment planning and medical device design, ultimately leading to new treatments for patients with cardiovascular disease. <br /></p>

									<p>For almost 20 years the Pegasus Workflow Management System has been designed, implemented and supported to provide abstractions that enable scientists to focus on structuring their computations without worrying about the details of the target cyberinfrastructure. To support these workflow abstractions Pegasus provides automation capabilities that seamlessly map workflows onto target resources, sparing scientists the overhead of managing the data flow, job scheduling, fault recovery and adaptation of their applications. Automation enables the delivery of services that consider criteria such as time-to-solution, as well as takes into account efficient use of resources, managing the throughput of tasks, and data transfer requests.</p>

									<p>The project deals with the further development and subsequent distribution of a suite of computer codes that can accurately describe the interaction of charged particles (mostly electrons) and light (mostly lasers and synchrotrons) with atoms and ions. The results are of significant importance for the understanding of fundamental collision dynamics, and they also fulfill the urgent practical need for accurate atomic data to model the physics of stars, plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies can now be conducted for realistic systems, as opposed to idealized models. Due to the high demand for data generated with the present program, the source code as well as instructional material to make the program usable by other interested researchers will be made publicly available.

									<p>Parallel Filesystems are a critical yet fragile component in modern HPC systems. As a resource that is shared and required by most jobs running on an HPC system, a single job can adversely impact all other jobs. This impact can vary from performance degradation to job failure. PFSTRASE monitors the filesystem at all times and provides the necessary information to immediately identify the contribution of every node, job, and user to the filesystem load. The monitoring agent that collects data generates negligible load on the filesystem servers and clients while the backend that analyzes and presents the data is scalable to the largest filesystems. The infrastructure currently supports Lustre but is designed to be extensible to other filesystems. A filesystem has been deployed to verify and validate the infrastructure. An Ansible-based provisioning system has been developed to enable the rapid deployment and reconfiguration of a Lustre filesystem.    </p>

									<p>The goal of our project is to continue to improve our software cyberinfrastructure aimed at solving important molecular-level problems in catalysis, drug design, energy conversion. Combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) models have enabled significant advances in our understanding of chemical reactivity. The shortcoming of QM/MM models when using ab initio or density functional theory (DFT) methods is the computational expense, which limits QM/MM modeling. The performance of QM methods has been greatly improved over the years through algorithmic and hardware improvements. In our poster we describe the enhancements and performance of our GPU enabled Quantum Interaction Computational Kernel (QUICK) QM program combined with the Sander molecular dynamics (MD) engine from AMBER. AMBER is one of the most popular simulations packages and has been supported and sustained by the AMBER developer community for ~30 years. The developed software is available to the community via the open source AMBERTools package (see http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php). </p>

									<p>Both collection of Earth observation data from satellites and modeling of physical processes have seen unprecedented advances in recent years, but data-derived information is not used to inform modeling in a systematic and automated fashion. This creates a bottleneck that is growing with the data revolution. The objective of this project is to develop a connection between Earth observation data and numerical models of Earth system processes, through the use of an automated classification and parameterization system proto-typed by the PI's group. To take matters another step forward towards a transformation of the data-modeling connection, we are developing a data-driven auto-adaptive classification system that will utilize satellite data to derive informants for numerical models. The cyberinfrastructure will be implemented in a general and transportable way, but its functionality will be demonstrated by  addressing a concrete open problem in glaciology: The acceleration during a glacier surge, which is characterized by  an increase to  100-200 times the flow normal velocity. Glacial accelerations are important, because they constitute the largest uncertainty in sea-level-rise assessment.</p>

									<p>This project focuses on enabling research into hazard mitigation for vulnerable buildings in Oklahoma subjected to the recent increase in induced seismicity, and cumulative damage due to successive earthquakes. This is being conducted by expanding cyberinfrastructure that transmits real-time geophysical and engineering data for use in algorithms to provide low frequency and static deformation measurements of ground motion and building response. The investigation covers differences between source processes and frequency content of earthquakes in tectonically active environments versus induced earthquakes in tectonically passive regions of oil and gas exploration and wastewater injection, which could also have significant implications for seismic hazard mitigation. The objectives will be accomplished by developing and demonstrating modules for the Antelope Environmental Monitoring System that transmit additional sensor data and products created in combination with seismic data. The system architecture will assure data integrity, reduce bandwidth requirements, and alleviate telecommunication bottlenecks from remote multi-sensor stations.<br /></p>

These maps support panning and zooming across the sky to progressively smaller scales, and are used widely for visualization in astronomy. They are, however, difficult to create at infrared wavelengths because of high background emission. Montage is an ideal tool for creating infrared maps for two reasons: it uses background modeling to rectify the time variable image backgrounds to a common level; and it uses an adaptive image stretch algorithm to convert the image data to display values for visualization. The creation of the maps involves the use of existing Montage tools in tandem with four new tools to support HiPS. We wil present images of infrared sky surveys in the HiPS scheme.</p>

									<p>The birth of the first stars and galaxies 13 billions years ago -- our "Cosmic Dawn" -- is one of the last unobserved periods in the history of the Universe. Scientists are working to observe the 21 cm radio light emitted by the primeval neutral hydrogen fog as the first stars formed and reionized the universe. One of the biggest challenges for the detection of the Epoch of Reionization is the presence of bright astrophysical foregrounds that obscures the signal of interest, requiring extraordinarily precise modeling and calibration of the radio telescopes performing these observations. The 21 cm cosmology community is rapidly developing new techniques for instrument calibration, foreground removal and analysis, but thorough testing and integration into existing data analysis pipelines has been slow. This project provides a software infrastructure that enables rigorous, seamless testing of novel algorithmic developments within a unified framework. This infrastructure also ensures a new level of reliability and reproducibility not previously possible and accelerates the speed at which developments become integrated into production level code, providing an invaluable foundation for bringing our field into the next decade and for leveraging the current NSF investments in these experiments.<br /></p>

In this poster we report on the progress towards this goal by describing advancements both in the development and application of the associated cyberinfrastructure. In particular, we report on the use of mathematical optimization techniques for the analysis of economically viable pathways for decarbonization of electrical power networks. We also report on the development of next-generation of interior point algorithms for convex optimization and their potential to revolutionize applications in machine learning and optimal control. Finally, we report on various community building activities. </p>

									<p>Geoscientists arrive at scientific results by analyzing observations from a diverse set of instrumentation and often assimilate them into a model. Effective collaboration between scientists can be hampered when they are using different resources, resulting in a lengthy and laborious process. Individual researchers need to assemble many of the community resources on their own before they can conduct successful research or get credit for their work. The Integrated Geoscience Observatory (InGeO) project tackles the problem of seamless collaboration between geoscientists by creating a platform where the data from disparate instruments can be brought together with software tools for data interpretation provided by the instrument operators.<br /><br />The primary goals of the InGeO project are to:<br />1. Provide tools that make it easy for geospace researchers to collaborate, share work, reproduce results, and build on tools that have already been developed.<br />2. Educate the geospace community on best practices for software development and data archiving to ensure data and the tools needed to work with it are available to a broad range of researchers in the community with minimal barriers to entry.<br /><br />Our solution to the first goal has been Resen - a tool to enable reproducibility and collaboration. Resen allows community developed toolkits to be easily accessed and creates a convenient mechanism for researchers to save and share their results along with the analysis that produced them. Resen is written in Python and uses Docker containers. The current software packages in Resen allow you to access common geospace data sources including MANGO, Madrigal and SuperDARN. We plan to add functionality for other data sources in the future releases.</p>

									<p>Distributed Workflows for Cyberexperimentation (Elie) is a new experiment representation. Elie enables the researcher to abstract the definition of an experiment from its realization. It encodes the desired behavior of an experiment at a high-level as a scenario (e.g. ‚Äúgenerate attack from A to B, wait 10 seconds, turn on defense at C‚Äù), and provides sufficient details as to how each action in a scenario can be realized on the testbed, via bindings (e.g. use script attack.py with specific parameters for the attack action). Elie further encodes only those features of testbed topology, which matter for the experiment, via constraints (e.g. ‚Äúuse Ubuntu OS on C‚Äù).<br /><br />When an experiment is to be realized on the testbed, the constraints section of Elie is used to generate a resource request for the testbed. Once the experiment is allocated‚Äîphysical nodes are reserved and loaded with the operating system‚Äîthe scenario and bindings are used, along with allocation details, to produce scripts, which run on the nodes.<br /><br />When the researcher runs the experiment on the testbed they parameterize and run these scripts, possibly interspersed with manual actions, which produces a run history. Together, the Elie representation, node allocations and the run history represent a complete record of an experiment, which can be shared and reused by others.</p>

The software leverages parallel computing paradigms (AVX vectorization, GPU cards, multi-core shared memory, and distributed memory). It has been used for Mars rover simulation, vehicle dynamics, autonomous vehicle and robotics simulation, wind energy harvesting, granular dynamics, off-road mobility analysis, planet formation, farming and food processing.

									<p>A team of experts from five universities (Duke, RPI, Caltech, Northwestern and Univ of Vermont) develops an open-source materials resource, NanoMine, to enable discovery of fundamental processing-structure-property (p-s-p) relationships for polymer nanocomposites and demonstrates extensibility through the creation of a sister resource for metamaterials, MetaMine. The framework enables annotation, organization and storage of composition, processing, microstructure and property data, along with an array of analysis tools and advanced learning algorithms that facilitate discovery of quantitative p-s-p relationships. A broad spectrum of users can query the system, identify materials that may have certain characteristics, and automatically produce information about these materials. The effort demonstrates the capability of the designed data framework through two domain case studies: discovery of factors controlling dissipation in nanocomposites, and tailored mechanical response in metamaterials motivated by an application to personalize running shoes. The project will significantly improve the representation of data and the robustness with which expanding user communities can identify promising materials applications, enabling new collaborations in materials discovery and design. Strong connections with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and Lockheed Martin facilitate industry and government use of the developing knowledge graph.</p>

									<p>Accelerating the development of novel materials that have desirable properties is a critical challenge as it can facilitate advances in diverse fields across science, engineering, and medicine. However, the current prevailing practice in materials discovery relies on trial-and-error experimental campaigns and/or high-throughput screening approaches, which cannot efficiently explore the huge design space to develop materials with the targeted properties. Furthermore, measurements of material composition, structure, and properties often contain considerable errors due to technical limitations in materials synthesis and characterization, making this exploration even more challenging. This project aims to develop an effective in-silico experimental design platform to accelerate the discovery of novel materials. The platform is built on optimal Bayesian learning and experimental design methodologies that can translate scientific principles into predictive models, in a way that takes model and data uncertainty into account. The optimal Bayesian experimental design framework will enable the collection of smart data that can help exploring the material design space efficiently, without relying on slow and costly trial-and-error and/or high-throughput screening approaches.</p>

									<p>High performance computing (HPC) has led to remarkable advances in science and engineering and has become an indispensable tool for research. Unfortunately, HPC use and adoption by many researchers is often hindered by the complex way in which these resources are accessed. Indeed, while the web has become the dominant access mechanism for remote computing services in virtually every computing area, it has not for HPC. Open OnDemand is an open source project to provide web based access to HPC resources.  The primary goal of OnDemand is to lower the barrier of entry and ease access to HPC resources for both new and existing users.

In this project, we propose the design and development of Hermes, a new, heterogeneous-aware, multi-tiered, dynamic, and distributed I/O buffering platform which provides: 1) Vertical and horizontal distributed buffering in the DMSH: 2) Selective buffering; 3) Adaptive and dynamic buffering via system and application profiling. We are developing new buffering algorithms and mechanisms that address the challenges of a DMSH ecosystem. This effort will eventually boost HDF5 core technology and facilitate an agile architecture that will allow the evolution of next generation I/O and will address the increasingly challenging scale and complexity of future systems.

									<p>To advance our fundamental understanding of the complex behaviors and interactions among the various Earth processes that are critical to the health, resilience and sustainability of water resources, scientists need to be able to use diverse data and integrate models outside their own disciplines with sufficient model accuracy and predictability. Currently, however, this is very difficult to accomplish: (1) a vast quantity of diverse data are not readily accessible to models; and (2) diverse models developed individually by different research groups are difficult to share and integrate cross disciplines. To address these critical challenges, we propose to develop an open and sustainable framework software in cyberinfrastructure (CI) that enables easy and incremental integration of diverse data and models for knowledge discovery and interdisciplinary team-work, and also enables reproducible computing and the seamless and on demand access to various HPC resources which are essential and desirable for communities. Our proposed project is fundamentally important and addresses urgent need in enabling new scientific advances for all water related issues.<br /><br />The goal of this NSF funded multi-institution multi-discipline project is to build an open data, open modeling framework software - a new cyberinfrastructure called CyberWater. CyberWater will expedite the process for fundamental knowledge discoveries and significantly reduce the time and effort on the part of users. Not only does it ease the way to bring together diverse data and model integration, model testing/validations/comparisons, etc. while ensuring reproducible computing, CyberWater also enables access to HPC facilities on demand. Our proposed framework is based on scientific workflow.</p>

									<p>Sustained progress in scientific endeavors in solar energy, functional, and nanoscale material sciences requires advanced methods and software components that can be used to model the complex dynamics of excited states, including charge and energy transfer. Within the current project, a range of advanced nonadiabatic and quantum dynamics (NA/QD) techniques such as independent and collective trajectory surface hopping methods, non-equilibrium Fermi golden rule rate calculations, and new quantum-classical decoherence schemes will be implemented and made available for future reuse via the open-source Libra library. These ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù will enable the testing new ideas and theories of NA/QD. The infrastructure of Libra methods and the related database of model problems will enable systematic assessment of various NA/QD methods, in order to standardize and rank a ‚Äúzoo‚Äù of the presently available methods. The first ‚ÄúJacob‚Äôs ladder‚Äù of NA/QD methods will be built to serve as a roadmap to theorists and practitioners. </p>

									<p>The design and discovery of new efficient and inexpensive solar energy materials can be accelerated via computational modeling of excited states dynamics in these systems. Nonetheless, training in this area remains relatively scarce; the community is often unaware of the available cyberinfrastructure, lacks the best practice guidelines, and may experience entry barriers to employing these advanced tools. This pilot project aims to fill the above gaps by providing targeted training to young scientists in the proficient use of advanced cyberinfrastructure for modeling excited states dynamics in solar energy materials. The project will leverage and combine the general-purpose Libra code library for modeling excited states dynamics and the Virtual Infrastructure for Data Intensive Analysis (VIDIA) platform for web-based data analysis and visualization, as well as the existing electronic structure packages. The resulting versatile gateway will enable advanced training in modeling excited states dynamics of solar energy materials. </p>

									<p>The new era of big data and machine learning (ML) is arising. Data- and ML-driven research is becoming a primary paradigm in broad science and engineering. However, the pandemic issue of missing data may hamper robust ML and statistical inference. The negative impact of incomplete data on ML and statistical learning (SL) may seriously depend upon data types and ML/SL methods. Existing data curing (imputation) methods are difficult for general researchers and often unsuitable for large/big, complex data. To overcome the challenges, this project embarked upon developing a new community-level of data-curing platform that can be deployable on NSF cyberinfrastructure and local HPC facilities. The novelty of this project lies in the fact that it requires no (or minimum) expert-level assumptions and has no restrictions on size, dimension, type, and complexity of data. This project‚Äôs service will pursue a novel combination of assumption-free, big data-oriented imputation theories, and parallel algorithms.</p>

However, the most common MD technique to compute thermal conductivity, the Green-Kubo method, yields incorrect results in LAMMPS for many-body potentials. The primary aim of this NSF CSSI project is to create and carefully implement the correct heat flux computation in LAMMPS, a problem made challenging by the fact that this software has hundreds of thousands of users and the solution must be merged into the core LAMMPS code. The objectives of the project are: (1) to implement a corrected heat flux computation for all supported many-body potentials in LAMMPS, (2) to identify the types of molecular systems most affected by the changed heat flux computations, and (3) apply and refine the methodology to predict thermal conductivity for several novel nanomaterials.</p>

									<p>The numerical solution of PDEs using finite elements and similar methods is ubiquitous in engineering and science  applications. Ideally, a PDE solver should be a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù: the user provides as input the domain boundary and boundary conditions, and the code returns an evaluator that can compute the value of the solution at any point of the domain. This is surprisingly far from being the case for almost all existing open-source or commercial software. One important source of non-robustness in solvers is treating meshing and FEM basis construction as two disjoint problems.  We present our work towards an integrated fully robust pipeline, considering meshing and basis construction as a single challenge. We will demonstrate that tackling the two problems jointly offers many advantages, based on testing with several PDEs on a large dataset.</p>

									<p>Successes in accelerated materials design, made possible in part through the Materials Genome Initiative, have shifted the bottleneck in materials development towards the synthesis of novel compounds. Existing databases do not contain information about the synthesis recipes necessary to produce compounds. As a result, much of the momentum and efficiency gained in the design process becomes gated by trial‚Äêand‚Äêerror synthesis techniques. This delay in going from promising materials concept to validation, optimization, and scale‚Äêup is a significant burden to the commercialization of novel materials. This research is developing a framework to do for materials synthesis what modern computational methods have done for materials properties: Build predictive tools for synthesis so that targeted compounds can be synthesized in a matter of days, rather than months or years.  This proposal extends efforts to include synthetic confirmation of hypotheses generated by predictive models.</p>

Infrastructure development is embedded in a science program focused on creating aluminum alloys resistant to spall failure in high-energy environments. Such alloys have high value in aircraft and spacecraft while understanding the underlying mechanism of failure has broad scientific importance in understanding ultimate material strength. The tight linkage of infrastructure development and science in this project is central to creating infrastructure that works to close the design loop and encourage more meaningful collaboration between domain experts.

									<p>Sea ice acts as both an indicator and an amplifier of climate change. Multiple sources of sea ice observations are obtained from a variety of networks of sensors (in situ, airborne, and space-borne). To facilitate the science community to better extract important geophysical parameters for climate modeling, we are developing a smart cyberinfrastructure module for the analyses of high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images of sea ice. The project contributes new domain knowledge to the sea ice community. It integrates HSR images that are spatiotemporally discrete to produce a rapid and reliable identification of ice types, and standardizes image processing so as to create compatible sea ice products. The cyberinfrastructure module is a value-added on-demand web service, e.g., reliable classification of sea ice, that can be easily integrated with existing infrastructure.The key objective is to develop a cyberinfrastructure to efferently collect, search, explore, visualize, organize, analyze and share HSR Arctic sea ice imagery.</p>

									<p>Hydrologic science studies the movement of water in the earth system. Continental scale simulation of this flow of water through rivers, streams and groundwater is an identified grand challenge in hydrology. Decades of model development, combined with advances in solver technology and software engineering have enabled large-scale, high-resolution simulations of the hydrologic cycle over the US, yet substantial technical and communication challenges remain.  Our interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and hydrologists is developing a framework to leverage advances in computer science transforming simulation and data-driven discovery in the Hydrologic Sciences and beyond. This project is advancing the science behind these national scale hydrologic models, accelerating their capabilities and building novel interfaces for user interaction.  Our framework brings computational and domain science (hydrology) communities together in order to move more quickly from tools (models, big data, high-performance computing) to discoveries.  Our framework facilitates decadal, national scale simulations, which are an unprecedented resource for both the hydrologic community and the much broader community of people working in water dependent systems (e.g., biological system, energy and food production). These simulations will enable the community to address scientific questions about water availability and dynamics from the watershed to the national scale.  Additionally, this framework is designed to facilitate multiple modes of interaction and engage a broad spectrum of users outside the hydrologic community. We will provide easy-to-access pre-processed datasets that can be visualized and plotted using built-in tools that will require no computer science or hydrology background.  Recognizing that most hydrology training does not generally include High Performance Computing and data analytics or software engineering, this framework will provide a gateway for computationally enhanced hydrologic discovery.  Additionally, for educators we will develop packaged videos and educational modules on different hydrologic systems geared towards K-12 classrooms.     </p>

Integrated advanced statistical analysis tools provide non-expert users with quantitative methods to validate novel theoretical descriptions of jet modification, by comparison with the complete set of current experimental data. To improve the efficiency of this computationally intensive task, the collaboration has developed trainable emulators that can accurately predict experimental observables by interpolation between full model runs, and employ accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for both the fluid dynamical simulations and the modification of jets.

									<p>Machine learning based representation of sub grid processes in climate simulation was proved in concept in 2018 by several research groups in the limit of an idealized aquaplanet. I will review some of the interesting findings from follow-on tests during the past two years that have clarified the potential for such an approach to work in more realistic settings focusing on the engineering lessons learned and the challenges that remain. Along the way I will discuss emerging diagnostics for testing the physical credibility of prototype emulators, the importance of formal hyperparameter tuning, the strategy we developed to incorporate physical constraints into hybrid machine learning models, and our new CSSI software that makes prognostic testing simpler. I will also share our latest measurements of skill when emulating explicit convection in a modern version of the Community Earth System Model that includes real geography, seasons, and diurnal cycles.</p>

								<div id="abstract1835904" class="dialog" title="Reproducible Visual Analysis of Multivariate Networks with MultiNet">
									<p>Multivariate networks -- datasets that link together entities that are associated with multiple different variables -- are a critical data representation for a range of high-impact problems, from understanding how our bodies work to uncovering how social media influences society. These networks capture information about relationships between entities as well as attributes of the entities and the connections. Tools used in practice today provide very limited support for reasoning about networks. This project aims fill this critical gap in the existing cyber-infrastructure ecosystem for reasoning about multivariate networks by developing MultiNet, a robust, flexible, secure, and sustainable open-source visual analysis system. The web-based tool, along with an underlying plug-in-based framework, will support three core capabilities: 1) interactive, task-driven visualization of both the connectivity and attributes of networks, 2) reshaping the underlying network structure to bring the network into a shape that is well suited to address analysis questions, and 3) leveraging provenance data to support reproducibility, communication, and integration in computational workflows. These capabilities will allow scientists to ask new classes of questions about network datasets, and lead to insights about a wide range of pressing topics. To meet this goal, we will ground the design of MultiNet in four deeply collaborative case studies with domain scientists in biology, neuroscience, sociology, and geology.</p>

We will give an overview of the already implemented and planned functionality of libkrylov including the recently developed non-orthonormal Krylov subspace methods, as well as design, data structures, and interfaces. The current implementation uses compile-time polymorphism and user-defined procedure encapsulation to enable high degrees of efficiency, generic coding, and ease of use.

									<p>Scientific and management challenges in the water domain are multi-disciplinary, requiring synthesis of data from multiple domains. Many data analysis tasks performed by water scientists are difficult because datasets are large and complex; standard formats for common data types are not always agreed upon nor mapped to an efficient structure for analysis; and water scientists generally lack training in scientific methods needed to efficiently tackle large and complex datasets. This project is advancing Data Science and Analytics for Water (DSAW) by developing: (1) an advanced object data model that maps common water-related data types to high performance Python data structures based on standard file, data, and content types established by the CUAHSI HydroShare system; and (2) new Python packages that enable scientists to automate retrieval of water data, loading it into high performance memory objects, and performing reproducible analyses that can be shared, collaborated around, and formally published for reuse.</p>

									<p>Most of our understanding about the Earth‚Äôs interior comes from seismology. Over the past decade, the huge success in many large-scale projects like the USArray component of Earthscope gave rise to a massive increase in the data volume available to the seismology community. Such data set has revealed the limitation of existing data processing infrastructure available to the seismologists. As a step towards addressing the issue, we devised a new framework we call Massive Parallel Analysis System for Seismologists (MsPASS), for seismic data processing and management.  MsPASS leverages existing big data technologies: (1) a scalable parallel processing framework based on a dataflow computation model (Spark), (2) a NoSQL database system centered on document store (MongoDB), and (3) a container-based virtualization environment (Docker and Singularity). The preliminary development indicates the basic components can be easily deployed on desktops to large modern high-performance computing systems.</p>

									<p>A key enabler of innovation and discovery for many scientific researchers is the ability to explore data and express ideas quickly as software prototypes. Tools and techniques that reduce the "time to insight" are essential to the productivity of researchers. At the same time, massive increases in data volumes and computational needs require a continual focus on maximizing code performance to realize the potential science from novel scientific apparatus. Programming language usability and interoperability are omni-disciplinary issues affecting today's scientific research community. As a result, a common approach across many scientific fields research is for scientists to program in Python, while steering kernels written in C++. This C++ as a service (CaaS) project brings a novel interpretative technology to science researchers through a state-of-the-art C++ execution environment. CaaS will enable both beginners and experts in C++. It enables higher-productivity in development and extends the interactive education and training platform for programming languages. CaaS will enable existing technologies as well as truly new development and analysis approaches. CaaS will directly support grow cyber-capabilities that advance scientific research across a broad range of pursuits.</p>

									<p>Research on Adaptive Intelligent Learning for K-12 and MOOCs (RAILKaM) cyber infrastructure will enable 20 researchers to run large-scale field experiments on basic principles in the educational contexts of K-12 mathematics learning and university Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs). RAILKaM will integrate ASSISTments, an online learning platform used by more than 100,000 K-12 students, with MOOCs offered by the University of Pennsylvania and used by hundreds of thousands of learners each year, in order to enable broader populations, more robust student interactions, and more bountiful data collection than currently feasible in either environment alone. RAILKaM will also support 75 data scientists by supplying carefully redacted datasets that protect student privacy. In facilitating 1) high-power, replicable experiments with diverse student populations and 2) extensive measurement, RAILKaM will increase the efficiency and ease of conducting quality educational research in online learning environments, bringing research methods and long-term learning outcomes to 21st-century classrooms.</p>

									<p>Galaxy is an open source, web-based framework that is extensively used by more than 20,000 researchers world-wide for conducting research in many areas such as genomics, molecular dynamics, chemistry, drug discovery, and natural language processing. It provides a web-based environment using which scientists perform various computational analyses on their data, exchange results from these analyses, explore new research concepts, facilitate student training, and preserve their results for future use. Galaxy currently runs on a large variety of high-performance computing (HPC) platforms including local clusters, supercomputers in national labs, public datacenters and Cloud. Unfortunately, while most of these systems supplement conventional CPUs with significant accelerator capabilities (in the form of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and/or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)), the current Galaxy implementation does not take advantage of these powerful accelerators. This is unfortunate because many Galaxy applications (e.g., sequence analysis, metabolomics, and metagenomics) are inherently parallelizable and can benefit from significant latency and throughput improvements when mapped to GPUs and FPGAs.<br />The main objectives of this proposed work are to (i) enable existing Galaxy tools to take full advantage of the immense computational capabilities offered by state-of-the-art GPUs and FPGAs, and at the same time, (ii) enlarge the Galaxy community by bringing the unique tool, analytics, data preservation and sharing capabilities provided by Galaxy to existing GPU and FPGA based applications from various domains that currently do not use Galaxy.</p>

									<p>Modern HPC platforms are using multiple CPU, GPUs and high-performance interconnects per node. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art production quality implementations of the popular Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming model do not have the appropriate support to deliver the best performance and scalability for applications (HPC and DL) on such dense GPU systems. The project involves a synergistic and comprehensive research plan, involving computer scientists from OSU and OSC and computational scientists from TACC, SDSC and UCSD. The proposed innovations include: 1) Designing high-performance and scalable communication operations that fully utilize multiple network adapters and advanced in-network computing features for GPU and CPU; 2) Designing novel datatype processing and unified memory management; 3) Designing CUDA-aware I/O; 4) Designing support for containerized environments; and 5) Carrying out integrated evaluation with a set of driving applications. Initial results from this project using the MVAPICH2 MPI library will be presented.</p>

									<p>This project extracts quantitative summaries of political and international conflict events among national and non-state actors across the world by combing news reports across the internet in multiple languages.  This generates event data, a machine-coded description of someone doing something to someone else as extracted from news reports. We focus on political and social events about conflict and cooperation between governments, individuals, non-governmental organizations, rebel groups, and others.  The main goal of this project is to integrate and expand our end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for the robust creation, validation, access, and analysis of political event data by national security, government, academic, and non-governmental actors.  A major component of this proposal is to continue to grow our engagement with the global event data community. Researchers in industry, academia, and the public sector have been using our software and system, and through increased engagement we hope to develop for this wide array of research purposes to promote basic science and national defense applications.  <br />This project extends, produces, and integrates a dynamic, robust system for event data to study sub-national and international conflict processes at a global scale, with applications to the needs of the national security and intelligence communities.</p>

									<p>This project aims at building a sustainable computational infrastructure for all-atom simulations of compounds and multiphase materials across the periodic table in high accuracy up to the 1000 nm scale. Cyberloop consolidates previously disconnected platforms for soft matter and solid state simulations (IFF, OpenKIM, and CHARMM-GUI) into a single unified framework. The new integrated infrastructure will enable users to set up complex bionanomaterial configurations, select reliable force fields, generate input scripts for popular simulation platforms, and assess the uncertainty in the results. Innovations include automated charge assignment protocols and file conversions, expansion of the Interface force field (IFF) and surface model databases, extension of the Open Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (OpenKIM) to bonded force fields and AI-based force field selection tools, and development of new Nanomaterial Builder and Bionano Builder modules in CHARMM-GUI. Cyberloop supports the discovery of the next generation of therapeutics, materials for energy conversion, and ultrastrong composites, and trains an interdisciplinary, diverse, and cyber-savvy workforce. </p>

									<p>This project creates an MPI programming infrastructure that can integrate performance analysis capabilities more directly, through the MPI Tools (MPI_T) Information Interface, monitor Performance metrics during run time, and deliver greater optimization opportunities for scientific applications. It integrates MVAPICH2 and the TAU Performance System using the MPI_T interface. MVAPICH2 exports performance variables (PVARs) and exposes key control variables (CVARs) to TAU using the MPI_T interface. MVAPICH2 has multiple optimized designs for collective operations. Choosing the algorithm that deliver the best performance for a given application is complicated and depends on several factors like message size, size of the job, availability of advanced hardware features etc. TAU provides a plugin framework where plugins interact with MVAPICH2 and read PVARs and set CVARs to effect runtime adaptation based on performance data.</p>

									<p>RIT and the City of Rochester are collaborating to address commonly present challenges in midsize cities. Democratizing data science is the notion that anyone, with little to no technical expertise, can do data science if provided the right data and user-friendly tools. The Citizenly project aims to realize this broad vision in urban context and challenges. This project will extract data from NY open data sets, readily available city‚Äôs data (e.g. building, crime, and transportation), and citizen-generated data to develop a hyper-relevant data set for the community. Citizens and city leaders, without requiring technical, will be able to create, share, and take advantage of urban data and applications for their respective communities. As part of initial work for this project, using the Citizenly approach, two urban use cases will be developed: optimal urban services resource allocation and health impact assessment of socio-economic factors. </p>

									<p>With the onset of any research/project, most of the time is spent on data acquisition (published and verified data sets suitable for the study), pre-processing (noise reduction, visualizing and manipulating the data to fit our research) and tool exploration (state-of-art techniques). Some preliminary analysis along with small-scale computations is needed to compare the tools' results while adjusting relevant software parameters and modal parameters. During this entire process, one has to explore various resources (how-to guides, research papers/journals, textbooks, internet) and/or seek ad-hoc advice from colleagues, collaborators, advisors. Most of the suggestions/recommendations go undocumented unless they were implemented and thus recorded. Also, different researchers need guidance during different stages of their research progress and in various forms. This project proposes the use of artificial intelligence to build a cyberinfrastructure tool that assists by utilizing  past experiences and other resources to carter to individual researcher's needs.</p>

LearnSphere spans existing educational data silos through sharing learning analytic components or DIBBS that scientists can use with or without programming. The key is a web-based workflow authoring tool called Tigris. To develop the user community we have held ten workshops reaching 100s of participants. LearnSphere has over 7000 unique user logins and 78 DIBBS components have been created in Tigris.

									<p>We will report on the status of the OSiRIS project (NSF Award #1541335, UM, IU, MSU and WSU) during its fifth and final year. OSiRIS is delivering a distributed Ceph storage infrastructure coupled together with software-defined networking to support multiple science domains across Michigan‚Äôs three largest research universities. The project‚Äôs goal is to provide a single scalable, distributed storage infrastructure that allows researchers at each campus to work collaboratively with other researchers across campus or across institutions. The NSF CC*DNI DIBBs program which funded OSiRIS is seeking solutions to the challenges of multi-institutional collaborations involving large amounts of data and we are exploring the creative use of Ceph and networking to address those challenges.</p>

									<p>This project catalyzes research in earth-surface dynamics by developing a software framework that enables rapid creation, refinement, and reuse of two-dimensional (2D) numerical models. The phrase earth-surface dynamics refers to a remarkably diverse group of science and engineering fields that deal with our planet's surface and near-surface environment: its processes, its management, and its responses to natural and human-made perturbations. Scientists who want to use an earth-surface model often build their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their model rather than taking advantage of codes that have already been written. Whereas the end result may be novel software programs, many person-hours are lost rewriting existing code, and the resulting software is often idiosyncratic, poorly documented, and unable to interact with other software programs in the same scientific community and beyond, leading to lost opportunities for exploring an even wider array of scientific questions than those that can be addressed using a single model. The Landlab model framework seeks to eliminate these redundancies and lost opportunities, and simultaneously lower the bar for entry into numerical modeling, by creating a user- and developer-friendly software library that provides scientists with the fundamental building blocks needed for modeling earth-surface dynamics. The framework takes advantage of the fact that nearly all surface-dynamics models share a set of common software elements, despite the wide range of processes and scales that they encompass. Providing these elements in the context of a popular scientific programming environment, with strong user support and community engagement, contributes to accelerating progress in the diverse sciences of the earth's surface.</p>

									<p>glue is an open-source python-based software package that enables scientists to explore relationships within and across related datasets. Without merging any data, glue makes it easy to make multi-dimensional linked visualizations of datasets, select subsets of data interactively or programmatically in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, and to see those selections propagate live across all open visualizations (e.g., histograms, 2 and 3-d scatter plots, images, 3-d volume renderings, etc.). While originally designed as a desktop application, we have built a new prototype interface for glue in JupyterLab, a browser-based environment that supports multi-panel interactive visualizations alongside narrative text, code, and figures. We demonstrate the functionality of glue in the JupyterLab environment, and show how it can be a powerful multi-disciplinary tool for making discoveries across many scientific disciplines.</p>

									<p>The CASM software package (a Clusters Approach to Statistical Mechanics) automates first-principles statistical mechanics simulations of crystalline solids. CASM is designed to algorithmically formulate effective Hamiltonians for a wide variety of chemical, electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within arbitrarily complex crystal structures. The CASM software then automates the tasks to parameterize the generalized effective Hamiltonians to first-principles training data. Subsequently it generates highly optimized (kinetic) Monte Carlo codes tailored for each effective Hamiltonian to enable finite temperature statistical mechanics simulations. These tools are ideally suited to study the coupling between a wide range of chemical and electronic excitations within crystalline solids at finite temperature and have found applications in multi-component alloys, battery materials, magnetic materials that are alloyed and strained and quantum materials.</p>

This will be achieved by implementing a parallel discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) package, developing a suite of DMD interaction potentials, and providing tools for translating continuous atomistic models into DMD models. Although there are many coarse-grained potentials and codes available to simulate large biomolecular systems, the longest times scales that can typically be accessed are on the order of tens of microseconds, and most are unable to predict the formation of structures such as fibrils in a reasonable time frame. Our tools will allow the scientific/engineering community to study long time-scale phenomena such as biopolymer folding, aggregation, and fibril formation. The code will be tested by volunteer users and validated both by comparison with literature results, and an experimental case study on peptoid-based inhibition of antibody aggregation. </p>

									<p>Spatial data often embedded with geographic references are important to numerous scientific domains (e.g., ecology, geography and spatial sciences, geosciences, and social sciences, to name just a few), and also beneficial to solving many critical societal problems (e.g., environmental and urban sustainability). In recent years, this type of data has exploded to massive size and significant complexity as increasingly sophisticated location-based sensors and devices (e.g., social networks, smartphones, and environmental sensors) are widely deployed and used. However, the tools and computational platforms available for processing synthesizing such data remain limited. Over the past couple of years, this project has helped establish CyberGIS-Jupyter as a platform for making geospatial data processing and analytics capabilities accessible. CyberGIS-Jupyter is an online geospatial computation platform for a large number of users to conduct and share scalable cyberGIS analytics via Jupyter Notebooks supported by advanced cyberinfrastructure resources such as those provisioned by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE).

									<p>The C2Metadata (‚ÄúContinuous Capture of Metadata‚Äù) Project automates the documentation of data transformations performed by statistical software.  Researchers in many fields use statistical software (SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, Python) for data transformation and data management as well as analysis.  C2Metadata tools translate scripts used by statistical software into an independent Structured Data Transformation Language (SDTL), which serves as an intermediate language for describing data transformations.   SDTL is incorporated into standard metadata formats (Data Documentation Initiative (DDI), Ecological Markup Language (EML), and JSON-LD), which are used for data discovery, codebooks, and auditing data management scripts.  C2Metadata differs from most previous approaches to provenance by focusing on documenting transformations at the variable level.</p>

									<p>Next-generation sequencing has lead to the generation of massive genomic datasets to explore the roles and functions of microorganisms in ecosystems. Comparative metagenomic aims to explore these datasets by them to one another and measuring their similarity globally. We developed an algorithm called Libra that uses Hadoop to perform all-vs-all sequence analysis on hundreds of metagenomes to identify microbial and viral signatures linked to key biological processes. Libra performs with unparalleled accuracy compared to existing tools on both simulated and real datasets using billions of reads. Libra‚Äôs state-of-the-art algorithm and its implementation on Hadoop allow it to achieve remarkable compute times and accuracy without requiring a reduction in dataset size or simplified distance metrics. Our tool is integrated into iMicrobe (http://imicrobe.us) where users can run Libra using their CyVerse account using their own datasets or those that are integrated into the OCC.</p>

(ii) Creation of a machine learning framework for materials scientists to accelerate the discovery of advanced materials. This framework contains synergistic building blocks that enable scientists to gather, model and visualize data. An easy-to-use graphical interface has also been developed to apply different state-of-the-art machine learning models on existing materials data. Performance comparison of different models as well as descriptors in terms of predicted properties is supported by the interface along with visualization of data and results to better understand physical phenomena</p>

									<p>The Local Spectroscopy Data Infrastructure (LSDI) Project is developing completely integrated platform for first-principles calculations of the so-called ‚Äúlocal‚Äù environment at atomic positions within a material, which can be revealed through NMR spectroscopy and local-probe X-ray absorption spectra. The infrastructure broadly addresses the needs of the growing community of chemists and materials scientists who rely on local-environment probe spectroscopy methods, which are relevant for defective, non-stoichiometric, and nano-crystalline materials and interfaces. These classes of materials are increasingly important across a range of applications, and no standardized spectral measurements are available or catalogued to accelerate characterization, understanding and design. Our project created robust, benchmarked workflows for calculating NMR, XAS, EELS, and other spectra and developed tools to use these massive data sets to better understand the local-environments that these techniques probe. </p>

									<p>Both high performance computing (HPC) clusters and Hadoop clusters use file systems. A Hadoop cluster uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) that resides on compute nodes, while an HPC cluster usually uses a remote storage system. Despite years of efforts on research and application development on HPC and Hadoop clusters, the file systems in both types of clusters still face a formidable challenge, that of achieving exascale computing capabilities. The centralized data indexing in HDFS and HPC storage architectures cannot provide high scalability and reliability, and both HDFS and HPC storage architectures have shortcomings such as single point of failure and insufficiently efficient data access. This project builds scalable high-availability data capabilities in data-centric cyberinfrastructure to overcome the shortcomings and create a highly scalable file system with new techniques for distributed load balancing, data replication and consistency maintenance. </p>

									<p>As data has become more abundant, and data resources become more heterogeneous, accessing, sharing, and disseminating these data sets become a bigger challenge. Using simple tools to remotely logon to computers and manually transfer data sets between sites is no longer feasible. Managed file transfer (MFT) services have allowed users to do more, but these services still rely on the users providing specific details to control this process, and they suffer from shortcomings, including low transfer throughput, inflexibility, limited protocol support, and poor scalability. OneDataShare is a universal data sharing building block for data-intensive applications, with three primary goals: (1) optimization of end-to-end data transfers and reduction of the time to delivery of the data; (2) interoperation across heterogeneous data resources and on-the-fly inter-protocol translation; and (3) prediction of the data delivery time to decrease the uncertainty in real-time decision-making processes. These capabilities are being developed as a cloud-hosted service. </p>

									<p>Persistent Homology (PH) is computationally expensive and cannot be directly applied on more than a few thousand data points. This project aims to develop mechanisms to allow the computation of PH on large, high-dimensional data sets. The proposed method will significantly reduce the run-time and memory requirements for the computation of PH without significantly compromising accuracy of the results. This project explores techniques to map a large point cloud P to another point cloud P' with fewer total points such that the topology space characterized by P and P' is nearly equivalent. The mapping from P to P' will potentially hide some of the smaller topological features during the PH computation on P'. Restoration of accurate PH results is achieved by (i) upscaling data for the identified large topological features, and (b) partition the data to run concurrent PH computations that locate the smaller topological features.</p>

									<p>Routine applications of electronic structure theory to molecules and periodic systems need to compute the electron density from given Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. System sizes can range from few to thousands or (in some cases) millions of atoms. Different discretization schemes (basis sets) and different system geometries (finite non-periodic vs. infinite periodic boundary conditions) dictate matrices with different structure. The ELectronic Structure Infrastructure (ELSI) project provides an open-source software interface to facilitate the implementation and optimal use of high-performance solver libraries covering cubic scaling eigensolvers, linear scaling density-matrix-based algorithms, and other reduced scaling methods in between. We cover the ELSI interface software itself, solvers connected to the interface, as well as practical handling (e.g., routines for density matrix extrapolation in geometry optimization and molecular dynamics calculations and general utilities such as parallel matrix I/O and JSON output). Finally, we present benchmarks comparing different solvers, carried out using the ELSI infrastructure on massively parallel supercomputers.<br /></p>

									<p>Many network cameras have been deployed for a wide range of purposes. The data from these cameras can provide rich information about the natural environment and human activities. To extract valuable information from this network of cameras, complex computer programs are needed to retrieve data from the geographically distributed cameras and to analyze the data. This project creates an open source software infrastructure by solving many problems common to different types of analysis programs. By using this infrastructure, researchers can focus on scientific discovery, not writing computer programs. This project can improve efficiency and thus reduce the cost for running programs analyzing large amounts of data. This infrastructure promotes education because students can obtain an instantaneous view of the network cameras and use the visual information to understand the world. Better understanding of the world may encourage innovative solutions for many pressing issues, such as better urban planning and lower air pollution. </p>

It provides the capability of accessing these models with a standardized user interface built upon Jupyter notebooks that are hosted on a cloud-based server. The ENKI API is written in Python.  The ENKI platform is designed to provide a uniform access to existing thermodynamic databases. The interface provides a straightforward way of calculating and comparing the thermodynamic properties of phases, the ability to construct phase diagrams, and the ability to perform generalized equilibrium calculations.  A key aspect of ENKI is the ability to formulate thermodynamic models as symbolic expressions, and to automatically generate from these expressions compatible computer code.  This capability supports calibration of thermochemical models from experimental data and encourages replicable and reproducible science. </p>

									<p>Parsl is an open source parallel programming library for Python, used by both small and large projects (e.g., LSST-DESC in astronomy, ArcticDEM and EarthDEM in geoscience). Parsl augments Python with simple, scalable, and flexible constructs for encoding parallelism. Developers annotate Python functions to create apps, which represent pure Python functions or calls to external applications, whether sequential, multicore, or multi-node MPI. Parsl further allows calls to these apps, called tasks, to be connected by shared input/output data (e.g., Python objects or files) via which Parsl can construct a dynamic dependency graph of tasks. Parsl scripts can be easily moved between different execution resources: local systems, clouds, clusters, supercomputers, and Kubernetes clusters: developers define a Python-based configuration that outlines where and how to execute tasks. Parsl scripts can scale from a single core through to O(100k) nodes on one or more supercomputers.</p>

									<p>Recent years have seen a massive explosion of datasets across all areas of science, engineering, technology, medicine, and the social sciences. The central questions are: How do we optimally learn from data through the lens of models? And how do we do so taking into account uncertainty in both data and models?  These questions can be mathematically framed as Bayesian inverse problems. While powerful and sophisticated approaches have been developed to tackle these problems, such methods are often challenging to implement and typically require first and second order derivatives that are not always available in existing computational models. We present an extensible software framework that overcomes this hurdle by providing unprecedented access to state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems and the ability to compute derivatives using adjoint-based methods. Our goal is to make these advanced inversion capabilities available to a broader scientific community, to provide an environment that accelerates scientific discovery.</p>

On the basis of these specifications, IPT translates the serial programs into working parallel versions using one of the three popular parallel programming paradigms, which are: MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. Hence, IPT can free the users from the burden of learning the low-level syntax of the different parallel programming paradigms, and any manual reengineering required for parallelizing the existing serial programs. The performance of the parallel versions generated using IPT is within 10% of the performance of the best hand-written parallel versions available to us. </p>

									<p>DNA origami, a method for constructing nanoscale objects, relies on a long single strand of DNA to act as the 'scaffold' to template assembly of numerous short DNA oligonucleotide 'staples', which assemble into megadalton-sized nanostructures comprised of tens of thousands of DNA bases. Designing and experimentally testing a DNA origami nanostructure can take more than 2 weeks effort, and cost over $1000 per design in materials and labor. Fast simulation tools can improve efficiency in this process. We present a GPU-powered simulation tool for DNA origami that can provide a robust 3D structure prediction in a matter of minutes.</p>

									<p>The need to store and manipulate massive data is ubiquitous.  Data arising from man-made artifacts such as hardware and software may exhibit a structure amenable to compact and efficient decision diagram techniques, a prime example being BDDs for symbolic model checking.<br /><br />In the last two decades, many extensions of BDDs have been proposed, but libraries implementing them have been lacking.  Our project addresses this need with Meddly, a software library that supports arbitrary discrete variable (including variables with unknown bounds and even with infinite domains, under certain restrictions), integer or real numerical ranges for the encoded functions (implemented either using multi-terminal or edge-valued decision diagrams), and various reduction and variable order techniques (to reduce the diagrams' size and the time to manipulate them).<br /><br />Applications of Meddly include traditional symbolic model checking, generation of minimal counterexamples, numerical solution of Markov chains, analysis of underspecified systems, integer constraint problems, and combinatorial optimization.<br /></p>

The WorldWide Telescope (WWT) provides a powerful data-visualization interface for data exploration and presentation. Through the open source WWT visualization software systems, this project enables the broader use of institutional and community-based, researcher-oriented astronomy data repositories and computational tools. The astronomy researcher workflow incorporates depositing data to make it discoverable through search and browsing, accessible through open access, actionable through connections to existing tools as well as community-developed tools running on CyVerse, and finally visualizing or citing data.

ChronusQ performs quantum dynamic simulations of the same light-matter interactions that occur in time-resolved multidimensional spectroscopies directly in the time-domain.  The software is unique, in that it seamlessly integrates time-dependent quantum mechanical theories, spectral analysis tools and modular high-performance numerical libraries that are highly parallelized, extensible, reusable, community-driven, and open-sourced. The ChronusQ software is well-designed and well-documented to promote reusability, composability, maintainability, and sustainability. ChronusQ will make predictions and interpretations of multi-dimensional spectral features as routine as it currently is for linear spectra, yielding a direct path to the discovery and design of molecules and materials that demonstrate new or enhanced high-order optical, magnetic, electronic, and plasmonic features.</p>

Second, enhance the Open MPI core to support new architectures and improve scalability. This includes rework of the startup environment that will improve process launch scalability, increase support for asynchronous progress of operations, enable support for accelerators, and reduce sensitivity to system noise.

In order to create a resource of broad appeal, the focus will be on three types of image processing: simple detection and labelling of objects based on detection of significant features and leveraging recent advances in deep learning, semi-custom pipelines and workflows based on popular image processing tools, and finally fully customizable analysis routines. Popular image processing pipeline tools will be leveraged to allow users to create or customize existing pipeline workflows and easily test these on large-scale cloud infrastructure from their desktop or mobile devices. In addition, a core cloud-based platform will be created where custom image processing can be created, shared, modified, and executed on large-scale datasets and apply novel methods to minimize data movement. Usage test cases will be created for three specific user communities: materials science, marine science and neuroscience.</p>

									<p>Mapped  averaging is  a recently published scheme  for the reformulation of  ensemble  averages. The framework uses  approximate results from  statistical mechanical  theory  to  derive  new ensemble  averages  (mapped averages) that  represent exactly the error in  the theory. Well-conceived  mapped  averages can be  computed  by  molecular simulation with  remarkable  precision and efficiency, and in  favorable cases the speedup factors are several orders  of magnitude.<br /><br />Harmonically  mapped  averaging (HMA) is  the application  of  mapped  averaging to crystalline systems.  It  enables simulation to  compute directly  the anharmonic contribution to  the properties,  without noise contributed by  harmonic  behavior.  The result  is  a technique for computing crystalline properties with unprecedented,  transformative efficiency.<br /><br />The aim of  this  project is  to  implement these methods on  well-established  and widely  used  software packages  for simulation of  crystalline systems,  and furthermore to  develop mapped averages  for new applications of  interest to the users of  these systems.</p>

									<p>The data volumes associated with image processing in astronomy can range from small sets of images taken by individual observers to large survey telescopes generating tens of petabytes of data per year. The tools used by researchers to analyze their images are often bespoke, tailored to specific tasks or science use cases. As part of an initiative to share analysis tools across astronomy (and broader communities) we are developing a cloud-aware analysis framework (the astronomy commons). We demonstrate here an image analysis system (built to process data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope; LSST)  that can be deployed on the cloud using Amazon's S3, RDS, Lambda, and EBS services together with HTCondor and Pegasus to manage the overall workflow. We demonstrate the scaling of this system (and associated processing costs) to the size of nightly data volumes expected from the LSST.</p>

									<p>Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) has been successful in computing electronic structure of strongly correlated materials specially when it is combined with density functional theory (DFT). Here, we present an open-source computational package combining DMFT with various DFT codes interfaced to a Wannier90 package for adopting maximally localized Wannier functions as local orbitals to describe a correlated subspace. Our package provides the library mode for computing a DMFT density matrix such that it can be efficiently linked to various DFT codes and achieve the charge-self-consistency within DFT+DMFT loops. We used our package for the study of well-known correlated materials, namely LaNiO3, SrVO3, and NiO to compute the density of states, the band structure, the total energy, the atomic force, and the Fermi surface within DFT+DMFT.</p>

									<p>Our goal is to build, test, and broadly disseminate new software modules for the real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) component in the massively parallel open-source Qb@ll code, to mitigate two most pressing limitations: (i) Large computational cost due to small time steps needed to control the numerical error of real-time integration. (ii) Limited accuracy of the electronic structure computed by commonly used exchange-correlation approximations. We will address this through developing‚Ä®(1) New modules for improved numerical integration of the underlying non-linear partial differential equations via strong stability-preserving Runge Kutta methods.‚Ä®(2) New modules that compute the electronic structure through a modern implementation of an advanced exchange-correlation functionals.  Our second objective is to disseminate these developments by building an academic-research HPC community with the Qb@ll code <br />(3) Development of convenient interfaces between the Qb@ll and other main-stream electronic-structure codes for data conversion.‚Ä®(4) Engagement of early scientists (PhDs and post-docs) by incorporating the hands-on training on RT-TDDFT using the Qb@ll code during TDDFT workshops.<br /></p>

									<p>We have long relied on increased raw computing power to drive technological progress. However, processors are now reaching their limits in terms of raw computing power, and continuing progress will require increased productivity in developing parallel software. Fully leveraging the performance of multi-core processors will in many cases require developers to make use of low-level "atomic" (or indivisible) operations such as those provided by the C11 and C++11 languages, so that can make very fine-grained optimizations to their code, and take full advantage of the computing power these processors offer them.  Writing code using C/C++ atomics is extremely difficult to do correctly and it is very easy to introduce subtle bugs in the use of these constructs.  Testing for concurrency bugs in code that uses C/C++11 atomics can be extremely difficult as a bug can depend on the schedule, the state of the processor's memory subsystem, the specific processor, and the compiler. The C11Tester project will develop tools for testing concurrent code that makes use of C/C++11 atomics and make these tools available to both researchers and practitioners.</p>

We are currently developing a software infrastructure to make the processes underlying systematic CG modeling accessible to other researchers and the public.

									<p>The MAtrix, TEnsor, and Deep-learning Optimized Routines (MATEDOR) project seeks to develop software technologies and standard APIs, along with a sustainable and portable library for large-scale computations, the individual parts of which are very small matrix or tensor computations. The main target is the acceleration of science and engineering applications that fit this profile, including deep learning, data mining, astrophysics, image and signal processing, hydrodynamics, and more. Working closely with affected application communities, we have defined modular, language agnostic APIs for batched computations. We incorporated the MATEDOR developments in a high-performance numerical library for batched linear algebra computations, autotuned for modern processor architectures and system designs. MATEDOR includes LAPACK routine equivalents for small dense problems, tensors, and application-specific operations, e.g., for deep learning. Routines are constructed as much as possible out of calls to batched BLAS routines and their look-alikes required in sparse computations. The software is released through the open source MAGMA library.</p>

									<p>Many scientific and societal grand challenges (e.g., emergency management, environmental sustainability, population growth, and rapid urbanization) are inherently geospatial as articulated in a number of visionary reports such as the NSF's Ten Big Ideas and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A variety of fields (e.g., environmental engineering and sciences, geosciences, and social sciences) are increasingly dependent on geospatial software to tackle these challenges. Critical and urgent efforts are also needed to prepare the next-generation workforce for computation- and/or data-intensive geospatial-related research and education, technological innovation, and real- world problem solving and decision making. In response, we have engaged diverse communities that develop and use geospatial concepts and software for conceptualizing a national Geospatial Software Institute (GSI). The mission of the GSI should be to transform geospatial software, cyberinfrastructure (CI), and data science across many fields to revolutionize diverse discovery and innovation by enhancing computational transparency and reproducibility. Its vision is a sustainable social and technical ecosystem to enable geospatial-inspired innovation and discovery. Overall, GSI is well-positioned to revolutionize many science domains while nurturing a high-performance, open, and sustainable geospatial software ecosystem across academia, government, and industry.</p>

									<p>Many science advances have been possible thanks to use of software. This software, also known as ‚Äúresearch software", has become essential to progress in science and engineering. The scientists who develop the software are experts in their discipline, but do not have sufficient understanding of the practices that make software development easier, and the software more robust, reliable, maintainable and sustainable. This is an unfortunate state of affairs as researchers in the UK and the US report that 90-95% rely on research software for their work. 63-70% of these researchers also believe that their work would not be possible if such software were to become unavailable. <br />Through a grant funded by the US National Science Foundation (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1743188) we have been engaged in a series of activities to understand specific challenges that make research software unsustainable and why researchers who develop software face uncertain career paths.

									<p>As countries around the world rapidly urbanize and continue investing in infrastructure, the vulnerability to extreme weather continues to grow. Due to the large infrastructure and population base, cities are disproportionately affected by weather extremes as was witnessed during recent storms. Challenged by the fact that cities are complex entities, current computational models have a bottleneck in providing a robust means of generating parameter statistics that define a city's morphology. This U-cube project will utilize a novel inverse modeling approach that addresses this bottleneck by utilizing satellite images, population, elevation, road, and typology data about the various zones in a city, to infer a 3D model of a city. From this digital city, a set of urban canopy parameters (UCP) will be distilled for use in simulation models to predict meteorology, and in long run air quality, health and behavior of a city. </p>

Such understanding will enable application developers/users, system administrators, and middleware developers to maximize the efficiency and performance of individual components that comprise a modern HPC system and solve different grand challenge problems. Moreover, determining the root cause of performance degradation is complex for the domain scientist. The scale of emerging HPC clusters further exacerbates the problem.

								<div id="abstract1835874" class="dialog" title="Collaborative Research: NSCI Framework: Software for Building a Community-Based Molecular Modeling Capability Around the Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF)">
									<p>Molecular simulation plays an important role in many sub-fields of science and engineering.<br />Systems composed of soft matter are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but molecular simulations of such systems pose particular computational challenges since the differences in potential energy between distant configurations are on the same order as the thermal motion, requiring time and/or ensemble-averaged data to be collected over long simulation trajectories for property evaluation. Furthermore, performing a molecular simulation of a soft matter system involves multiple steps, which have traditionally been performed by researchers in a ``bespoke'' fashion. The result is that many soft matter simulations are not reproducible based on the information provided in a publication, and large-scale screening of soft materials systems is a formidable challenge. To address the issues of reproducibility and computational screening capability, we have been developing the Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) software suite. We also propose a set of principles to render molecular simulations Transparent, Reproducible, Usable by others, and Extensible (TRUE). While it is not required to use MoSDeF to create TRUE simulations, MoSDeF facilitates the publication and dissemination of TRUE simulations by automating many of the critical steps in performing molecular simulations, thus enhancing their reproducibility.</p>

									<p>Citizen science engages members of the public in science. It advances the progress of science by involving more people and embracing new ideas. Recent projects use software and apps to do science more efficiently. However, existing citizen science software and databases are ad hoc, non-interoperable, non-standardized, and isolated, resulting in data and software siloes that hamper scientific advancement. This project will develop new software and integrate existing software, apps, and data for citizen science - allowing expanded discovery, appraisal, exploration, visualization, analysis, and reuse of software and data. Over the three phases, the software of two platforms, CitSci.org and CyberTracker, will be integrated and new software will be built to integrate and share additional software and data. The project will: (1) broaden the inclusivity, accessibility, and reach of citizen science; (2) elevate the value and rigor of citizen science data; (3) improve interoperability, usability, scalability and sustainability of citizen science software and data; and (4) mobilize data to allow cross-disciplinary research and meta-analyses.</p>

									<p>The cyberinfrastructure needs for gravitational wave astrophysics, high energy physics, and large-scale electromagnetic surveys have rapidly evolved in recent years. The construction and upgrade of the facilities used to enable scientific discovery in these disparate fields of research have led to a common pair of computational grand challenges: (i) datasets with ever-increasing complexity and volume; and (ii) data mining analyses that must be performed in real-time. Furthermore, the convergence of gravitational wave astrophysics with electromagnetic and astroparticle surveys, the very birth of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, has already provided a glimpse of the transformational discoveries that it will enable in years to come. In this project, we aim to develop an open source toolkit consisting of advanced deep learning algorithms for particle physics detectors and gravitational wave detectors that are accelerated on heterogeneous computing platforms consisting of both graphics processing units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). For this project, we are developing both the algorithms and toolkit to ensure the lowest possible latencies of deep learning inference so that real-time data analysis can be performed and foundational physics discoveries can be made. </p>

									<p>In today's data-driven research environment, the ability to easily and reliably access compute, storage, and derived data sources is as much a necessity as the algorithms used to make the actual discoveries. The earth is not shrinking, it is digitizing, and the ability for US researchers to stay competitive in the global research community will increasingly be determined by their ability to reduce the time from theory to discovery. The Agave Platform addresses this need by providing a Science-as-a-Service cloud platform that allows researchers to run code, manage data, collaborate meaningfully, and integrate virtually anything. In doing so, it eases the process of conducting reproducible science in today's distributed, collaborative digital labs. Agave is available to use as a publicly available, cloud-hosted PaaS, as well as a self-hosted service for internal use.

									<p>Much of science today is propelled by multi-institutional research collaborations that require computing environments that connect instrumentation, data, and computational resources. These resources are distributed among university research computing centers, national-scale high performance computing facilities, and commercial cloud service providers. The scale of the data and complexity of the science drive this diversity, and the need to aggregate resources from many sources into scalable computing systems. Services Layer At The Edge (SLATE) provides technology that simplifies connecting university and laboratory data center capabilities to the national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem and thus expands the reach of domain-specific science gateways and multi-site research platforms. </p>

		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			The 2020 NSF CSSI PI Meeting is an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the NSF CSSI PI Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Definition of Sexual Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person may be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.<br /><br />
				Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Other Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Discrimination:</dt>
			<dd>
				Discrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person's competence or suitability.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Retaliation:</dt>
			<dd>
				Retaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment.
			</dd>
			<dt>Reporting an Incident:</dt>
			<dd>
				Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported immediately to the Organizing Committee Members (email: CSSI-PI-Meeting2020 at googlegroups dot com). All complaints will be treated seriously and be investigated promptly. Confidentiality will be honored to the extent permitted as long as the rights of others are not compromised.  Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the 2018 NSF CSSI PI Meeting, to the notification of appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
