			<h2>2020 NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) Principal Investigator Meeting</h2>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<p class="tagline">Towards a National Cyberinfrastructure Ecosystem</p>
				<p>February 13-14, 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle, Washington</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			This NSF PI meeting aims at further building the community around the NSF CSSI and its precursor programs (DIBBs, SI2) toward a national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. The meeting provides a forum for PIs to share technical information about their projects with each other, NSF program directors and others; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and new collaborations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At least one representative (PI/Co-PI/senior personnel) from each active CSSI, SI2 and DIBBS project is required by NSF to attend the meeting and give a one-minute lightning talk and a poster presentation on their project. For a <u>collaborative project with multiple awards</u>, one representative from the entire project is required. Anyone who is interested in attending the meeting is welcome and encouraged to do so. There is no registration fee, but participants need to register by the deadline to allow for planning logistics such as space and food.
		</p>
		<p>
			This meeting venue is in close vicinity to and concurrently with the <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/pp20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (PP20)</a>. Attendees of PP20 are encouraged to join and interact with CSSI investigators and visit the poster sessions in the CSSI PI meeting.

									<p>The goal of this project is to provide the scientific community with easily accessible high-quality atomic data and user-friendly broadly-applicable modern relativistic code to treat electronic correlations. The code will be capable of calculating a very broad range of atomic properties to answer the significant needs of atomic, plasma, and astrophysics communities. We also propose a creation on an online portal for high-precision atomic physics data and computation that will provide a variety of services to address the needs of the widest possible community of users. The portal will contribute a novel element to today's U.S.  cyberinfrastructure ecosystem, improving usability and access for the atomic physics community and their fields of application.</p>

									<p>In developing investment priorities, the CSSI programs seeks to engage the capabilities, curiosity and creativity CI research community PIs. Ongoing feedback from and dialogue with PIs from the CI research community is therefore critical. Surveys are an efficient and effective mechanism for staying connected and collecting input. This session describes the methodology and results of a survey of principal investigators (PIs), co-PIs, and others the CI research community. The survey, which was carried out by the Nexight Group under the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) Award (#1930025), had two primary purposes. First, the survey was designed to inform decisions about changes to be made to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) solicitation. Second, the survey was designed to inform decisions about the future direction and focus of the NSF CSSI umbrella program. The survey results provide insights that enhance CSSI’s support of a cyberinfrastructure for scientific research.</p>

									<p>Reasoning about real-world social habitats often represented as  multiplexed co-evolving networks is complicated and scientifically challenging due to their size, co-evolutionary nature and the need for representing multiple dynamical processes simultaneously. The 2014 Ebola epidemic, 2009 financial crisis, global migration, societal impacts of natural and human initiated disasters and the effect of climate change provide examples of the many challenges faced when developing such environments.  Advances in computing has fundamentally altered how such networks can be synthesized, analyzed and reasoned.</p>
									<p>We will briefly describe our work on co-evolving socio-technical networks by drawing on our work in urban transport planning, national security and public health epidemiology to guide the discussion. We will conclude by describing an exciting new project funded by the NSF that aims to develop CINES: a scalable cyberinfrastructure for network science.  CINES builds on a prior NSF project, CINET and serve as a community resource for network science. CINES provide an extensible platform for producers and consumers of network science data, information, and software.</p>

									<p>Soil moisture is a critical variable that links climate dynamics with water and food security. It regulates land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., via evapotranspiration---the loss of water from evaporation and plant transpiration to the atmosphere), and it is directly linked with plant productivity and plant survival. The current availability in soil moisture data over large areas comes from remote sensing (i.e., satellites with radar sensors), which provides nearly global coverage of soil moisture at spatial resolution of tens of kilometers. Satellite soil moisture data has two main shortcomings. First, although satellites can provide daily global information, they are limited to coarse spatial resolution (at the multi-kilometer scale). Second, satellites are unable to measure soil moisture in areas of dense vegetation, snow cover, or extremely dry surfaces; this results in gaps in the data.</p>
									<p>In this talk, we will present how we address these two shortcomings with a modular SOil MOisture Spatial Inference Engine (SOMOSPIE). SOMOSPIE consists of modular components including input of available data at its native spatial resolution, selection of a geographic region of interest, prediction of missing values across the entire region of interest (i.e., gap-filling), analysis of generated predictions, and visualization of both predictions and analyses. To predict soil moisture, our engine leverages hydrologically meaningful terrain parameters (e.g., slope and topographic wetness index) calculated using an open source platforms for standard terrain analysis (i.e., SAGA-GIS or System for Automated GeoScientific Analysis-Geographical Information System) and a suite of machine learning methods. We will present empirical studies of the engine's functionality including an assessment of data processing and fine-grained predictions over United States ecological regions with a highly diverse soil moisture profile.</p>

									<p>Image registration is an inherently ill-posed problem that lacks a unique mapping between voxels of the two images being registered. As such, we must confine the registration to only physically meaningful transforms by regularizing it via an appropriate penalty term which can be calculated numerically or analytically. The numerical approach, however, is computationally expensive depending on the image size, and therefore analytical methods are preferable. Using cubic B-splines as the basis for registration, we develop a generalized mathematical framework that accommodates five distinct types of regularizers: diffusion, curvature, linear elastic, third-order, and total displacement. We validate our approach by testing the accuracy achieved by each of the regularizers against their numerical counterpart. We also provide benchmarking results showing that the analytic solutions run significantly faster --- up to two orders of magnitude --- than central-differencing based numerical solutions.<br /><br />As a case study, we show how to use deformable registration to improve the accuracy of the Multi-atlas based segmentation (MABS). The effect of various regularizers on MABS accuracy is compared using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics.</p>

									<p>Expanding opportunities for data-driven research and increasing requirements for data management in sponsored research have resulted in a growing need for retention of both long-term archival data sets that are infrequently accessed, as well as 'active archives' of data that are accessed periodically to revisit, revise, and share experimental results. For this project, the University of South Dakota acquired, deployed, and maintains the South Dakota Data Store (SDDS), a network-accessible, sharable, multi-campus storage resource integrated with existing campus cyberinfrastructure. SDDS supports twelve STEM projects across eight departments at four institutions in South Dakota, including 30 faculty, 43 postdocs, and 303 students. SDDS provides South Dakota researchers with a centralized, efficient, high-performance platform for both archival of and shared access to large quantities of electronic data.</p>

The project team has previously developed SimVascular (www.simvascular.org), which is currently the only open source software package providing a complete pipeline from medical image data segmentation to patient specific blood flow simulation and analysis in arteries and veins. The SimCardio open source project will extend and enhance the functionality of SimVascular to the realm of heart modeling, providing the first fully integrated computer model of cardiac physiology and function. This will help basic science and medical researchers perform computer modeling in numerous diseases affecting heart function in children and adults. This computer modeling software will enable researchers to build models of the heart and vascular anatomy directly from medical imaging data, which can be used for personalized treatment planning and medical device design, ultimately leading to new treatments for patients with cardiovascular disease. <br /></p>

With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies can now be conducted for realistic systems, as opposed to idealized models.

									<p>Parallel Filesystems are a critical yet fragile component in modern HPC systems. As a resource that is shared and required by most jobs running on an HPC system, a single job can adversely impact all other jobs. This impact can vary from performance degradation to job failure. PFSTRASE monitors the filesystem at all times and provides the necessary information to immediately identify the contribution of every node, job, and user to the filesystem load. The monitoring agent that collects data generates negligible load on the filesystem servers and clients while the backend that analyzes and presents the data is scalable to the largest filesystems. The infrastructure currently supports Lustre but is designed to be extensible to other filesystems. A filesystem has been deployed to verify and validate the infrastructure. An Ansible-based provisioning system has been developed to enable the rapid deployment and reconfiguration of a Lustre filesystem.    </p>

The performance of QM methods has been greatly improved over the years through algorithmic and hardware improvements. In our poster we describe the enhancements and performance of our GPU enabled Quantum Interaction Computational Kernel (QUICK) QM program combined with the Sander molecular dynamics (MD) engine from AMBER.

									<p>Both collection of Earth observation data from satellites and modeling of physical processes have seen unprecedented advances in recent years, but data-derived information is not used to inform modeling in a systematic and automated fashion. This creates a bottleneck that is growing with the data revolution. The objective of this project is to develop a connection between Earth observation data and numerical models of Earth system processes, through the use of an automated classification and parameterization system proto-typed by the PI's group. To take matters another step forward towards a transformation of the data-modeling connection, we are developing a data-driven auto-adaptive classification system that will utilize satellite data to derive informants for numerical models. The cyberinfrastructure will be implemented in a general and transportable way, but its functionality will be demonstrated by  addressing a concrete open problem in glaciology: The acceleration during a glacier surge, which is characterized by  an increase to  100-200 times the flow normal velocity. Glacial accelerations are important, because they constitute the largest uncertainty in sea-level-rise assessment.</p>

									<p>This project focuses on enabling research into hazard mitigation for vulnerable buildings in Oklahoma subjected to the recent increase in induced seismicity, and cumulative damage due to successive earthquakes. This is being conducted by expanding cyberinfrastructure that transmits real-time geophysical and engineering data for use in algorithms to provide low frequency and static deformation measurements of ground motion and building response. The investigation covers differences between source processes and frequency content of earthquakes in tectonically active environments versus induced earthquakes in tectonically passive regions of oil and gas exploration and wastewater injection, which could also have significant implications for seismic hazard mitigation. The objectives will be accomplished by developing and demonstrating modules for the Antelope Environmental Monitoring System that transmit additional sensor data and products created in combination with seismic data. The system architecture will assure data integrity, reduce bandwidth requirements, and alleviate telecommunication bottlenecks from remote multi-sensor stations.<br /></p>

Montage is an ideal tool for creating infrared maps for two reasons: it uses background modeling to rectify the time variable image backgrounds to a common level; and it uses an adaptive image stretch algorithm to convert the image data to display values for visualization. The creation of the maps involves the use of existing Montage tools in tandem with four new tools to support HiPS. We wil present images of infrared sky surveys in the HiPS scheme.</p>

									<p>The birth of the first stars and galaxies 13 billions years ago -- our "Cosmic Dawn" -- is one of the last unobserved periods in the history of the Universe. Scientists are working to observe the 21 cm radio light emitted by the primeval neutral hydrogen fog as the first stars formed and reionized the universe. One of the biggest challenges for the detection of the Epoch of Reionization is the presence of bright astrophysical foregrounds that obscures the signal of interest, requiring extraordinarily precise modeling and calibration of the radio telescopes performing these observations. The 21 cm cosmology community is rapidly developing new techniques for instrument calibration, foreground removal and analysis, but thorough testing and integration into existing data analysis pipelines has been slow. This project provides a software infrastructure that enables rigorous, seamless testing of novel algorithmic developments within a unified framework.

This results into individual researchers needing many resources before they can conduct effective research or get credit for their work.<br />The Ingegrated Geoscience Observatory (InGeO) Project tackles the problem of seamless collaboration between geoscientists by creating a platform where the data from disparate instruments can be brought together with software tools for data interpretation provided by the instrument operators. The InGeO website outlines the project and resources available - https://ingeo.datatransport.org/home/.<br /><br />The primary goals of the InGeO project are to:<br /><br />1. Provide tools that make it easy for geospace researchers to colaborate, share work, reproduce results, and build on tools that have already been developed.<br /><br />2. Educate the geospace community on best practices for software development and data archiving to ensure data and the tools needed to work with it are available to a broad range of researchers in the community with minimal barriers to entry.<br /><br />Our solution to goal 1 has been Resen - https://ingeo.datatransport.org/home/resen. This allows community developed toolkits to be easily accessed and used and creates a convenient mechanism for reserachers to save and share not only their results, but the analysis they did to produce them. Resen is written in python 3 and is available at https://github.com/EarthCubeInGeo/resen with documentation, including installation and workflow instructions at https://resen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Currently, the available software packages in Resen allow you to access data sources including MANGO, Madrigal and SuperDARN. We plan to add functionality for other data sources in the future releases.</p>

									<p>Distributed Workflows for Cyberexperimentation (Elie) is a new experiment representation. Elie enables the researcher to abstract the definition of an experiment from its realization. It encodes the desired behavior of an experiment at a high-level as a scenario (e.g. ‚Äúgenerate attack from A to B, wait 10 seconds, turn on defense at C‚Äù), and provides sufficient details as to how each action in a scenario can be realized on the testbed, via bindings (e.g. use script attack.py with specific parameters for the attack action). Elie further encodes only those features of testbed topology, which matter for the experiment, via constraints (e.g. ‚Äúuse Ubuntu OS on C‚Äù).<br /><br />When an experiment is to be realized on the testbed, the constraints section of Elie is used to generate a resource request for the testbed. Once the experiment is allocated‚Äîphysical nodes are reserved and loaded with the operating system‚Äîthe scenario and bindings are used, along with allocation details, to produce scripts, which run on the nodes.<br /><br />When the researcher runs the experiment on the testbed they parameterize and run these scripts, possibly interspersed with manual actions, which produces a run history. Together, the Elie representation, node allocations and the run history represent a complete record of an experiment, which can be shared and reused by others.</p>

Chrono provides simulation support for applications that roughly belong to the computational dynamics field: flexible and rigid body dynamics (Newton-Euler equations), fluid-solid interaction problems (mass balance and Navier Stokes), and granular dynamics (friction/contact/impact constitutive laws). The software leverages parallel computing paradigms (AVX vectorization, GPU cards, multi-core shared memory, and distributed memory). It has been used for Mars rover simulation, vehicle dynamics, autonomous vehicle and robotics simulation, wind energy harvesting, granular dynamics, off-road mobility analysis, planet formation, farming and food processing. It has an online forum with more than 300 registered users and it is released off GitHub as open source under a permissive BSD3 license. Release 5.0 is slated for February 2020.</p>

									<p>Accelerating the development of novel materials that have desirable properties is a critical challenge as it can facilitate advances in diverse fields across science, engineering, and medicine. However, the current prevailing practice in materials discovery relies on trial-and-error experimental campaigns and/or high-throughput screening approaches, which cannot efficiently explore the huge design space to develop materials with the targeted properties. Furthermore, measurements of material composition, structure, and properties often contain considerable errors due to technical limitations in materials synthesis and characterization, making this exploration even more challenging. This project aims to develop an effective in-silico experimental design platform to accelerate the discovery of novel materials. The platform is built on optimal Bayesian learning and experimental design methodologies that can translate scientific principles into predictive models, in a way that takes model and data uncertainty into account. The optimal Bayesian experimental design framework will enable the collection of smart data that can help exploring the material design space efficiently, without relying on slow and costly trial-and-error and/or high-throughput screening approaches.</p>

Unfortunately, HPC use and adoption by many researchers is often hindered by the complex way in which these resources are accessed. Indeed, while the web has become the dominant access mechanism for remote computing services in virtually every computing area, it has not for HPC. Open OnDemand is an open source project to provide web based access to HPC resources.  The primary goal of OnDemand is to lower the barrier of entry and ease access to HPC resources for both new and existing users. Through OnDemand users can create, edit, upload/download files, create, edit, submit and monitor jobs, create and share apps, run GUI applications and connect to a terminal, all via a web browser, with no client software to install and configure.</p>

									<p>Modern HPC and distributed systems come equipped with deep memory and storage hierarchies (DMSH). The expert knowledge required to manage these multi-tier storage environments puts their benefits out of reach for most scientists and researchers. In this project, we propose the design and development of Hermes, a new, heterogeneous-aware, multi-tiered, dynamic, and distributed I/O buffering platform which provides: 1) Vertical and horizontal distributed buffering in the DMSH: 2) Selective buffering; 3) Adaptive and dynamic buffering via system and application profiling. We are developing new buffering algorithms and mechanisms that address the challenges of a DMSH ecosystem. This effort will eventually boost HDF5 core technology and facilitate an agile architecture that will allow the evolution of next generation I/O and will address the increasingly challenging scale and complexity of future systems. Hermes software is intended to support new scientific/engineering methodologies and will be carefully designed, implemented, and thoroughly tested. <br /></p>

									<p>To advance our fundamental understanding of the complex behaviors and interactions among the various Earth processes that are critical to the health, resilience and sustainability of water resources, scientists need to be able to use diverse data and integrate models outside their own disciplines with sufficient model accuracy and predictability. Currently, however, this is very difficult to accomplish: (1) a vast quantity of diverse data are not readily accessible to models; and (2) diverse models developed individually by different research groups are difficult to share and integrate cross disciplines. To address these critical challenges, we propose to develop an open and sustainable framework software in cyberinfrastructure (CI) that enables easy and incremental integration of diverse data and models for knowledge discovery and interdisciplinary team-work, and also enables reproducible computing and the seamless and on demand access to various HPC resources which are essential and desirable for communities. Our proposed project is fundamentally important and addresses urgent need in enabling new scientific advances for all water related issues.<br /><br />The goal of this NSF funded multi-institution multi-discipline project is to build an open data, open modeling framework software - a new cyberinfrastructure called CyberWater. CyberWater will expedite the process for fundamental knowledge discoveries and significantly reduce the time and effort on the part of users. Not only does it ease the way to bring together diverse data and model integration, model testing/validations/comparisons, etc. while ensuring reproducible computing, CyberWater also enables access to HPC facilities on demand. Our proposed framework is based on scientific workflow.</p>

									<p>PlasmaPy is an open source Python package for plasma physics that is currently under development.  The ultimate goal of this project is to foster a community-wide open source software ecosystem for plasma research and education.  Following Astropy's model, functionality needed across disciplines is being implemented in the PlasmaPy core package, while more specialized functionality will be developed in affiliated packages.  We strive to use best practices from software engineering that have heretofore been uncommon in plasma physics, including continuous integration testing and code review.  We will describe code development and community building activities from the first few months of our NSF CSSI award and plans for the next five years.</p>

									<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used extensively to study thermal transport in materials, and one of the most widely used MD software packages is LAMMPS. However, the most common MD technique to compute thermal conductivity, the Green-Kubo method, yields incorrect results in LAMMPS for many-body potentials. The primary aim of this NSF CSSI project is to create and carefully implement the correct heat flux computation in LAMMPS, a problem made challenging by the fact that this software has hundreds of thousands of users and the solution must be merged into the core LAMMPS code. The objectives of the project are: (1) to implement a corrected heat flux computation for all supported many-body potentials in LAMMPS, (2) to identify the types of molecular systems most affected by the changed heat flux computations, and (3) apply and refine the methodology to predict thermal conductivity for several novel nanomaterials.</p>

									<p>The numerical solution of PDEs using finite elements and similar methods is ubiquitous in engineering and science  applications. Ideally, a PDE solver should be a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù: the user provides as input the domain boundary and boundary conditions, and the code returns an evaluator that can compute the value of the solution at any point of the domain. This is surprisingly far from being the case for almost all existing open-source or commercial software. One important source of non-robustness in solvers is treating meshing and FEM basis construction as two disjoint problems.  We present our work towards an integrated fully robust pipeline, considering meshing and basis construction as a single challenge. We will demonstrate that tackling the two problems jointly offers many advantages, based on testing with several PDEs on a large dataset.</p>

								<div id="abstract1922311" class="dialog" title="The Synthesis Genome: Data Mining for Synthesis of New Materials">
									<p>Successes in accelerated materials design, made possible in part through the Materials Genome Initiative, have shifted the bottleneck in materials development towards the synthesis of novel compounds. Existing databases do not contain information about the synthesis recipes necessary to produce compounds. As a result, much of the momentum and efficiency gained in the design process becomes gated by trial‚Äêand‚Äêerror synthesis techniques. This delay in going from promising materials concept to validation, optimization, and scale‚Äêup is a significant burden to the commercialization of novel materials. This research is developing a framework to do for materials synthesis what modern computational methods have done for materials properties: Build predictive tools for synthesis so that targeted compounds can be synthesized in a matter of days, rather than months or years.  This proposal extends efforts to include synthetic confirmation of hypotheses generated by predictive models.</p>

									<p>The key objective is to develop a reliable and efficient on-demand Open Geospatial Consortium-compliant web service, which is capable of extracting accurate geographic knowledge of water, submerged ice, bare ice, melt ponds, deformed 'ridging' ice, ridge shadows, and other information from HSR images with limited human intervention. The embedded spatial-temporal analysis framework provides functions to search, explore, visualize, organize, and analyze the discrete HSR images and other related remote sensing data and field data. The project creates a data and knowledge web service for the Arctic sea ice community by integrating computer vision and machine learning algorithms, computing resources, and HSR image data and other useful datasets. The conceptual model improves data flow, so users would query data, download value-added data, and have more consistent results across various sources of information. This creates new opportunities for scientific analysis that minimizes the investment of time in processing complex and spatiotemporally-discrete HSR imagery. The project includes a strong emphasis on teaching and development of the next-generation workforce through course curricula development, involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research, and the offering of summer workshops for K-12 teachers (funded by other agencies). The collected images and results of the image analyses will be shared with the public in a timely manner through the NSF Arctic Data Center.</p>

Integrated advanced statistical analysis tools provide non-expert users with quantitative methods to validate novel theoretical descriptions of jet modification, by comparison with the complete set of current experimental data. To improve the efficiency of this computationally intensive task, the collaboration has developed trainable emulators that can accurately predict experimental observables by interpolation between full model runs, and employ accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for both the fluid dynamical simulations and the modification of jets. This framework exists within a user-friendly envelope that allows for continuous modifications, updates and improvements of each of its components.</p>

									<p>Multivariate networks ‚Äì datasets that link together entities that are associated with multiple different variables ‚Äì are a critical data representation for a range of high-impact problems, from understanding how our bodies work to uncovering how social media influences society. These networks capture information about relationships between entities as well as attributes of the entities and the connections. Tools used in practice today provide very limited support for reasoning about networks. This project aims fill this critical gap in the existing cyber-infrastructure ecosystem for reasoning about multivariate networks by developing MultiNet, a robust, flexible, secure, and sustainable open-source visual analysis system. The web-based tool, along with an underlying plug-in-based framework, will support three core capabilities: 1) interactive, task-driven visualization of both the connectivity and attributes of networks, 2) reshaping the underlying network structure to bring the network into a shape that is well suited to address analysis questions, and 3) leveraging provenance data to support reproducibility, communication, and integration in computational workflows. These capabilities will allow scientists to ask new classes of questions about network datasets, and lead to insights about a wide range of pressing topics. To meet this goal, we will ground the design of MultiNet in four deeply collaborative case studies with domain scientists in biology, neuroscience, sociology, and geology.</p>

Such data set has revealed the limitation of existing data processing infrastructure available to the seismologists. As a step towards addressing the issue, we devised a new framework we call Massive Parallel Analysis System for Seismologists (MsPASS), for seismic data processing and management.  MsPASS leverages existing big data technologies: (1) a scalable parallel processing framework based on a dataflow computation model (Spark), (2) a NoSQL database system centered on document store (MongoDB), and (3) a container-based virtualization environment (Docker and Singularity).

Tools and techniques that reduce the "time to insight" are essential to the productivity of researchers. At the same time, massive increases in data volumes and computational needs require a continual focus on maximizing code performance to realize the potential science from novel scientific apparatus. Programming language usability and interoperability are omni-disciplinary issues affecting today's scientific research community. As a result, a common approach across many scientific fields research is for scientists to program in Python, while steering kernels written in C++. This C++ as a service (CaaS) project brings a novel interpretative technology to science researchers through a state-of-the-art C++ execution environment. CaaS will enable both beginners and experts in C++. It enables higher-productivity in development and extends the interactive education and training platform for programming languages. CaaS will enable existing technologies as well as truly new development and analysis approaches. CaaS will directly support grow cyber-capabilities that advance scientific research across a broad range of pursuits.</p>

									<p>Infectious diseases can spread in locations where people congregate. Air travel, in particular, is a leading factor in the spread of infections, and there have been several outbreaks of serious diseases that spread during air travel. The spread of directly transmitted diseases is governed by the movement patterns of people because the movement can bring an infected person close to others. Pedestrian dynamics provides mathematical models that can accurately simulate the movement of individuals in a crowd. These models allow scientists to understand how different policies, such as boarding procedures on planes, can prevent, or make worse, the transmission of infections. This project is developing an innovative software that will provide a variety of pedestrian dynamics models, infection spread models, as well as data so that scientists can analyze the effect of different mechanisms on the spread of directly transmitted diseases in crowded areas. </p>

									<p>This project aims to enhance the IBAMR computer modeling and simulation infrastructure that provides advanced implementations of the immersed boundary method and its extensions with support for adaptive mesh refinement. Most current IBAMR models assume that the properties of the fluid are uniform, but many physical systems involve multiphase fluid models with inhomogeneous properties, such as air-water interfaces or the complex fluid environments of biological systems. This project aims to extend recently developed support in IBAMR for treating multiphase flows and enhance the modeling capability to treat multiphase polymeric fluid flows, which are commonly encountered in biological systems, and to treat reacting flows with complex chemistry, which are relevant to models of combustion, astrophysics, and additive manufacturing using stereolithography. This project also aims to re-engineer IBAMR for massive parallelism, so that it may effectively use very large computational resources in service of applications that require very high fidelity. </p>

									<p>This project extracts quantitative summaries of political and international conflict events among national and non-state actors across the world by combing news reports across the internet in multiple languages.  This generates event data, a machine-coded description of someone doing something to someone else as extracted from news reports. We focus on political and social events about conflict and cooperation between governments, individuals, non-governmental organizations, rebel groups, and others.  The main goal of this project is to integrate and expand our end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for the robust creation, validation, access, and analysis of political event data by national security, government, academic, and non-governmental actors.  A major component of this proposal is to continue to grow our engagement with the global event data community. Researchers in industry, academia, and the public sector have been using our software and system, and through increased engagement we hope to develop for this wide array of research purposes to promote basic science and national defense applications.  <br />This project extends, produces, and integrates a dynamic, robust system for event data to study sub-national and international conflict processes at a global scale, with applications to the needs of the national security and intelligence communities.</p>

The new integrated infrastructure will enable users to set up complex bionanomaterial configurations, select reliable force fields, generate input scripts for popular simulation platforms, and assess the uncertainty in the results. Innovations include automated charge assignment protocols and file conversions, expansion of the Interface force field (IFF) and surface model databases, extension of the Open Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (OpenKIM) to bonded force fields and AI-based force field selection tools, and development of new Nanomaterial Builder and Bionano Builder modules in CHARMM-GUI.

It integrates MVAPICH2 and the TAU Performance System using the MPI_T interface. MVAPICH2 exports performance variables (PVARs) and exposes key control variables (CVARs) to TAU using the MPI_T interface. MVAPICH2 has multiple optimized designs for collective operations. Choosing the algorithm that deliver the best performance for a given application is complicated and depends on several factors like message size, size of the job, availability of advanced hardware features etc. TAU provides a plugin framework where plugins interact with MVAPICH2 and read PVARs and set CVARs to effect runtime adaptation based on performance data.</p>

LearnSphere spans existing educational data silos through sharing learning analytic components or DIBBS that scientists can use with or without programming. The key is a web-based workflow authoring tool called Tigris. To develop the user community we have held ten workshops reaching 100s of participants. LearnSphere has over 7000 unique user logins and 78 DIBBS components have been created in Tigris.

									<p>VIFI presents a transformative infrastructure solution that empower data users to discover, analyze, transform, and evaluate distributed, fragmented data without direct access to or movement of large amounts of data, enabling analyses that are otherwise impossible, infeasible, or impractical. VIFI provides data users support for the full lifecycle of inquiry and data-driven discovery. VIFI also empowers data owners to expose data indirectly and facilitates automated methods for data-driven insights to broader communities. VIFI enables this novel support by tying together: remote storage; distributed orchestration and hybrid infrastructure management; distributed data management; publishing; and, transparent access to resources. Most importantly, VIFI removes barriers between utilizing, developing, and remixing interfaces to data through a generalized, discipline-agnostic approach, and enables communities to investigate questions that otherwise are impossible, infeasible, or impractical to explore. VIFI demonstrates its capabilities within multiple science and engineering domains, including Earth Science, Astronomy, and Sustainable Human-Building Ecosystems.</p>

									<p>This project catalyzes research in earth-surface dynamics by developing a software framework that enables rapid creation, refinement, and reuse of two-dimensional (2D) numerical models. The phrase earth-surface dynamics refers to a remarkably diverse group of science and engineering fields that deal with our planet's surface and near-surface environment: its processes, its management, and its responses to natural and human-made perturbations. Scientists who want to use an earth-surface model often build their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their model rather than taking advantage of codes that have already been written. Whereas the end result may be novel software programs, many person-hours are lost rewriting existing code, and the resulting software is often idiosyncratic, poorly documented, and unable to interact with other software programs in the same scientific community and beyond, leading to lost opportunities for exploring an even wider array of scientific questions than those that can be addressed using a single model. The Landlab model framework seeks to eliminate these redundancies and lost opportunities, and simultaneously lower the bar for entry into numerical modeling, by creating a user- and developer-friendly software library that provides scientists with the fundamental building blocks needed for modeling earth-surface dynamics. The framework takes advantage of the fact that nearly all surface-dynamics models share a set of common software elements, despite the wide range of processes and scales that they encompass. Providing these elements in the context of a popular scientific programming environment, with strong user support and community engagement, contributes to accelerating progress in the diverse sciences of the earth's surface.</p>

									<p>Hydrologic science studies the movement of water in the earth system. Continental scale simulation of this flow of water through rivers, streams and groundwater is an identified grand challenge in hydrology. Decades of model development, combined with advances in solver technology and software engineering have enabled large-scale, high-resolution simulations of the hydrologic cycle over the US, yet substantial technical and communication challenges remain.  Our interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and hydrologists is developing a framework to leverage advances in computer science transforming simulation and data-driven discovery in the Hydrologic Sciences and beyond. This project is advancing the science behind these national scale hydrologic models, accelerating their capabilities and building novel interfaces for user interaction.  Our framework brings computational and domain science (hydrology) communities together in order to move more quickly from tools (models, big data, high-performance computing) to discoveries.  Our framework facilitates decadal, national scale simulations, which are an unprecedented resource for both the hydrologic community and the much broader community of people working in water dependent systems (e.g., biological system, energy and food production). These simulations will enable the community to address scientific questions about water availability and dynamics from the watershed to the national scale.  Additionally, this framework is designed to facilitate multiple modes of interaction and engage a broad spectrum of users outside the hydrologic community. We will provide easy-to-access pre-processed datasets that can be visualized and plotted using built-in tools that will require no computer science or hydrology background.  Recognizing that most hydrology training does not generally include High Performance Computing and data analytics or software engineering, this framework will provide a gateway for computationally enhanced hydrologic discovery.  Additionally, for educators we will develop packaged videos and educational modules on different hydrologic systems geared towards K-12 classrooms.     </p>

									<p>glue is an open-source python-based software package that enables scientists to explore relationships within and across related datasets. Without merging any data, glue makes it easy to make multi-dimensional linked visualizations of datasets, select subsets of data interactively or programmatically in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, and to see those selections propagate live across all open visualizations (e.g., histograms, 2 and 3-d scatter plots, images, 3-d volume renderings, etc.). While originally designed as a desktop application, we have built a new prototype interface for glue in JupyterLab, a browser-based environment that supports multi-panel interactive visualizations alongside narrative text, code, and figures. We demonstrate the functionality of glue in the JupyterLab environment, and show how it can be a powerful multi-disciplinary tool for making discoveries across many scientific disciplines.</p>

									<p>The CASM software package (a Clusters Approach to Statistical Mechanics) automates first-principles statistical mechanics simulations of crystalline solids. CASM is designed to algorithmically formulate effective Hamiltonians for a wide variety of chemical, electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within arbitrarily complex crystal structures. The CASM software then automates the tasks to parameterize the generalized effective Hamiltonians to first-principles training data. Subsequently it generates highly optimized (kinetic) Monte Carlo codes tailored for each effective Hamiltonian to enable finite temperature statistical mechanics simulations. These tools are ideally suited to study the coupling between a wide range of chemical and electronic excitations within crystalline solids at finite temperature and have found applications in multi-component alloys, battery materials, magnetic materials that are alloyed and strained and quantum materials.</p>

									<p>The goal of this proposed research is to develop an open software framework to enable multi-millisecond dynamic simulations of peptides and peptidomimetic polymers. This will be achieved by implementing a parallel discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) package, developing a suite of DMD interaction potentials, and providing tools for translating continuous atomistic models into DMD models. Although there are many coarse-grained potentials and codes available to simulate large biomolecular systems, the longest times scales that can typically be accessed are on the order of tens of microseconds, and most are unable to predict the formation of structures such as fibrils in a reasonable time frame. Our tools will allow the scientific/engineering community to study long time-scale phenomena such as biopolymer folding, aggregation, and fibril formation. The code will be tested by volunteer users and validated both by comparison with literature results, and an experimental case study on peptoid-based inhibition of antibody aggregation. </p>

									<p>Spatial data often embedded with geographic references are important to numerous scientific domains (e.g., ecology, geography and spatial sciences, geosciences, and social sciences, to name just a few), and also beneficial to solving many critical societal problems (e.g., environmental and urban sustainability). In recent years, this type of data has exploded to massive size and significant complexity as increasingly sophisticated location-based sensors and devices (e.g., social networks, smartphones, and environmental sensors) are widely deployed and used. However, the tools and computational platforms available for processing synthesizing such data remain limited. Over the past couple of years, this project has helped establish CyberGIS-Jupyter as a platform for making geospatial data processing and analytics capabilities accessible.

									<p>The C2Metadata (“Continuous Capture of Metadata”) Project automates the documentation of data transformations performed by statistical software.  Researchers in many fields use statistical software (SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, Python) for data transformation and data management as well as analysis.  C2Metadata tools translate scripts used by statistical software into an independent Structured Data Transformation Language (SDTL), which serves as an intermediate language for describing data transformations.   SDTL is incorporated into standard metadata formats (Data Documentation Initiative (DDI), Ecological Markup Language (EML), and JSON-LD), which are used for data discovery, codebooks, and auditing data management scripts.  C2Metadata differs from most previous approaches to provenance by focusing on documenting transformations at the variable level. </p>

									<p>Next-generation sequencing has lead to the generation of massive genomic datasets to explore the roles and functions of microorganisms in ecosystems. Comparative metagenomic aims to explore these datasets by them to one another and measuring their similarity globally. We developed an algorithm called Libra that uses Hadoop to perform all-vs-all sequence analysis on hundreds of metagenomes to identify microbial and viral signatures linked to key biological processes. Libra performs with unparalleled accuracy compared to existing tools on both simulated and real datasets using billions of reads. Libra‚Äôs state-of-the-art algorithm and its implementation on Hadoop allow it to achieve remarkable compute times and accuracy without requiring a reduction in dataset size or simplified distance metrics. Our tool is integrated into iMicrobe (http://imicrobe.us) where users can run Libra using their CyVerse account using their own datasets or those that are integrated into the OCC.</p>

(ii) Creation of a machine learning framework for materials scientists to accelerate the discovery of advanced materials. This framework contains synergistic building blocks that enable scientists to gather, model and visualize data. An easy-to-use graphical interface has also been developed to apply different state-of-the-art machine learning models on existing materials data.

									<p>The Local Spectroscopy Data Infrastructure (LSDI) Project is developing completely integrated platform for first-principles calculations of the so-called ‚Äúlocal‚Äù environment at atomic positions within a material, which can be revealed through NMR spectroscopy and local-probe X-ray absorption spectra. The infrastructure broadly addresses the needs of the growing community of chemists and materials scientists who rely on local-environment probe spectroscopy methods, which are relevant for defective, non-stoichiometric, and nano-crystalline materials and interfaces. These classes of materials are increasingly important across a range of applications, and no standardized spectral measurements are available or catalogued to accelerate characterization, understanding and design.

									<p>Both high performance computing (HPC) clusters and Hadoop clusters use file systems. A Hadoop cluster uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) that resides on compute nodes, while an HPC cluster usually uses a remote storage system. Despite years of efforts on research and application development on HPC and Hadoop clusters, the file systems in both types of clusters still face a formidable challenge, that of achieving exascale computing capabilities. The centralized data indexing in HDFS and HPC storage architectures cannot provide high scalability and reliability, and both HDFS and HPC storage architectures have shortcomings such as single point of failure and insufficiently efficient data access. This project builds scalable high-availability data capabilities in data-centric cyberinfrastructure to overcome the shortcomings and create a highly scalable file system with new techniques for distributed load balancing, data replication and consistency maintenance. </p>

									<p>As data has become more abundant, and data resources become more heterogeneous, accessing, sharing, and disseminating these data sets become a bigger challenge. Using simple tools to remotely logon to computers and manually transfer data sets between sites is no longer feasible. Managed file transfer (MFT) services have allowed users to do more, but these services still rely on the users providing specific details to control this process, and they suffer from shortcomings, including low transfer throughput, inflexibility, limited protocol support, and poor scalability. OneDataShare is a universal data sharing building block for data-intensive applications, with three primary goals: (1) optimization of end-to-end data transfers and reduction of the time to delivery of the data; (2) interoperation across heterogeneous data resources and on-the-fly inter-protocol translation; and (3) prediction of the data delivery time to decrease the uncertainty in real-time decision-making processes.

The mapping from P to P' will potentially hide some of the smaller topological features during the PH computation on P'.  Restoration of accurate PH results is achieved by (i) upscaling data for the identified large topological features, and (b) partition the data to run concurrent PH computations that locate the smaller topological features.</p>

System sizes can range from few to thousands or (in some cases) millions of atoms. Different discretization schemes (basis sets) and different system geometries (finite non-periodic vs. infinite periodic boundary conditions) dictate matrices with different structure. The ELectronic Structure Infrastructure (ELSI) project provides an open-source software interface to facilitate the implementation and optimal use of high-performance solver libraries covering cubic scaling eigensolvers, linear scaling density-matrix-based algorithms, and other reduced scaling methods in between. We cover the ELSI interface software itself, solvers connected to the interface, as well as practical handling (e.g., routines for density matrix extrapolation in geometry optimization and molecular dynamics calculations and general utilities such as parallel matrix I/O and JSON output). Finally, we present benchmarks comparing different solvers, carried out using the ELSI infrastructure on massively parallel supercomputers.<br /></p>

									<p>A three-year SI2-SSI project is proposed to develop a python-based open-source software framework for data-driven interface materials science. This framework will be built on the existing pymatgen, custodian and FireWorks software libraries, integrating them into a complete, user-friendly, and flexible system for high-throughput ab initio computations and analysis. This SSI will greatly expand the capabilities of this framework beyond ground state bulk electronic structure calculations, targeting developmental efforts on three key focus areas of great interest to interface materials science: (i) Ab-initio thermodynamics of surfaces and interfaces; ii) Advanced methods for materials kinetics and diffusion at materials interfaces; and iii) Automated algorithms for structural construction of grain boundary. This project has yielded more than 18 peer-reviewed research articles, including one recent article published in the most prestigious journal Energy and Environmental Science (with impact factor 33.250), which has been widely reported in multiple media and yielded broad impacts. </p>

									<p>ENKI is an open source software framework designed to facilitate the construction and maintenance of thermodynamic models of naturally occurring materials. It provides the capability of accessing these models with a standardized user interface built upon Jupyter notebooks that are hosted on a cloud-based server. The ENKI API is written in Python.  The ENKI platform is designed to provide a uniform access to existing thermodynamic databases. The interface provides a straightforward way of calculating and comparing the thermodynamic properties of phases, the ability to construct phase diagrams, and the ability to perform generalized equilibrium calculations.  A key aspect of ENKI is the ability to formulate thermodynamic models as symbolic expressions, and to automatically generate from these expressions compatible computer code.  This capability supports calibration of thermochemical models from experimental data and encourages replicable and reproducible science. </p>

									<p>Parsl is an open source parallel programming library for Python, used by both small and large projects (e.g., LSST-DESC in astronomy, ArcticDEM and EarthDEM in geoscience). Parsl augments Python with simple, scalable, and flexible constructs for encoding parallelism. Developers annotate Python functions to create apps, which represent pure Python functions or calls to external applications, whether sequential, multicore, or multi-node MPI. Parsl further allows calls to these apps, called tasks, to be connected by shared input/output data (e.g., Python objects or files) via which Parsl can construct a dynamic dependency graph of tasks. Parsl scripts can be easily moved between different execution resources: local systems, clouds, clusters, supercomputers, and Kubernetes clusters: developers define a Python-based configuration that outlines where and how to execute tasks. Parsl scripts can scale from a single core through to O(100k) nodes on one or more supercomputers.</p>

									<p>Recent years have seen a massive explosion of datasets across all areas of science, engineering, technology, medicine, and the social sciences. The central questions are: How do we optimally learn from data through the lens of models? And how do we do so taking into account uncertainty in both data and models?  These questions can be mathematically framed as Bayesian inverse problems. While powerful and sophisticated approaches have been developed to tackle these problems, such methods are often challenging to implement and typically require first and second order derivatives that are not always available in existing computational models. We present an extensible software framework that overcomes this hurdle by providing unprecedented access to state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems and the ability to compute derivatives using adjoint-based methods. Our goal is to make these advanced inversion capabilities available to a broader scientific community, to provide an environment that accelerates scientific discovery.</p>

Our software includes a Python based workflow system for machine learning of many-body potential energy functions (PEFs) that integrates numerical tools for generating molecular configurations, electronic structure calculations, training set generation, PEF code generation, PEF parameter training, and PEF export for simulation codes, facilitated via centralized database storage.

It solicits the specifications for parallelization from the users, such as, what to parallelize and where. On the basis of these specifications, IPT translates the serial programs into working parallel versions using one of the three popular parallel programming paradigms, which are: MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. Hence, IPT can free the users from the burden of learning the low-level syntax of the different parallel programming paradigms, and any manual reengineering required for parallelizing the existing serial programs. The performance of the parallel versions generated using IPT is within 10% of the performance of the best hand-written parallel versions available to us. </p>

Second, enhance the Open MPI core to support new architectures and improve scalability. This includes rework of the startup environment that will improve process launch scalability, increase support for asynchronous progress of operations, enable support for accelerators, and reduce sensitivity to system noise.

									<p>The primary goal is to create a large scale distributed image processing infrastructure, the LIMPID, though a broad,  interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers in databases, image analysis, and sciences.  In order to create a resource of broad appeal, the focus will be on three types of image processing: simple detection and labelling of objects based on detection of significant features and leveraging recent advances in deep learning, semi-custom pipelines and workflows based on popular image processing tools, and finally fully customizable analysis routines.  Popular image processing pipeline tools will be leveraged to allow users to create or customize existing pipeline workflows and easily test these on large-scale cloud infrastructure from their desktop or mobile devices. In addition, a core cloud-based platform will be created where custom image processing can be created, shared, modified, and executed on large-scale datasets and apply novel methods to minimize data movement. </p>

									<p>Mapped  averaging is  a recently<br />published scheme  for the reformulation<br />of  ensemble  averages.

									<p>The data volumes associated with image processing in astronomy can range from small sets of images taken by individual observers to large survey telescopes generating tens of petabytes of data per year. The tools used by researchers to analyze their images are often bespoke, tailored to specific tasks or science use cases. As part of an initiative to share analysis tools across astronomy (and broader communities) we are developing a cloud-aware analysis framework (the astronomy commons). We demonstrate here an image analysis system (built to process data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope; LSST)  that can be deployed on the cloud using Amazon's S3, RDS, Lambda, and EBS services together with HTCondor and Pegasus to manage the overall workflow. We demonstrate the scaling of this system (and associated processing costs) to the size of nightly data volumes expected from the LSST.</p>

We use a custom kernel to transform the sparse 3D space of hits and tracks into a dense 1D dataset, and then apply Deep Learning techniques to find PV locations using proxy distributions to encode the truth in training data. Last year we reported that training networks on our kernels using several Convolutional Neural Network layers yielded better than 90% efficiency with no more than 0.2 False Positives (FPs) per event. Modifying several elements of the algorithm, we now achieve better than 94% efficiency with a significantly lower FP rate.</p>

Our package provides the library mode for computing a DMFT density matrix such that it can be efficiently linked to various DFT codes and achieve the charge-self-consistency within DFT+DMFT loops.

									<p>We have long relied on increased raw computing power to drive technological progress. However, processors are now reaching their limits in terms of raw computing power, and continuing progress will require increased productivity in developing parallel software. Fully leveraging the performance of multi-core processors will in many cases require developers to make use of low-level "atomic" (or indivisible) operations such as those provided by the C11 and C++11 languages, so that can make very fine-grained optimizations to their code, and take full advantage of the computing power these processors offer them.  Writing code using C/C++ atomics is extremely difficult to do correctly and it is very easy to introduce subtle bugs in the use of these constructs.  Testing for concurrency bugs in code that uses C/C++11 atomics can be extremely difficult as a bug can depend on the schedule, the state of the processor's memory subsystem, the specific processor, and the compiler. The C11Tester project will develop tools for testing concurrent code that makes use of C/C++11 atomics and make these tools available to both researchers and practitioners.</p>

The main target is the acceleration of science and engineering applications that fit this profile, including deep learning, data mining, astrophysics, image and signal processing, hydrodynamics, and more. Working closely with affected application communities, we have defined modular, language agnostic APIs for batched computations. We incorporated the MATEDOR developments in a high-performance numerical library for batched linear algebra computations, autotuned for modern processor architectures and system designs. MATEDOR includes LAPACK routine equivalents for small dense problems, tensors, and application-specific operations, e.g., for deep learning. Routines are constructed as much as possible out of calls to batched BLAS routines and their look-alikes required in sparse computations. The software is released through the open source MAGMA library.</p>

Critical and urgent efforts are also needed to prepare the next-generation workforce for computation- and/or data-intensive geospatial-related research and education, technological innovation, and real- world problem solving and decision making. In response, we have engaged diverse communities that develop and use geospatial concepts and software for conceptualizing a national Geospatial Software Institute (GSI). The mission of the GSI should be to transform geospatial software, cyberinfrastructure (CI), and data science across many fields to revolutionize diverse discovery and innovation by enhancing computational transparency and reproducibility.

Due to the large infrastructure and population base, cities are disproportionately affected by weather extremes as was witnessed during recent storms. Challenged by the fact that cities are complex entities, current computational models have a bottleneck in providing a robust means of generating parameter statistics that define a city's morphology. This U-cube project will utilize a novel inverse modeling approach that addresses this bottleneck by utilizing satellite images, population, elevation, road, and typology data about the various zones in a city, to infer a 3D model of a city.

									<p>Software has become indispensable to society. However, the properties of software systems cannot be understood without accounting for code transformations applied by optimizing compilers used to compose algorithm and data structure templates, and libraries available only in binary form. To address this need, we have been enhancing the Dyninst binary analysis and instrumentation toolkit to provide a foundation for performance, correctness, and security tools. We accelerate Dyninst to analyze large binaries using multiple threads to parse machine code and ingest symbol tables. Using Dyninst, we are building data race detection tools for OpenMP programs. In HPCToolkit performance tools, we use Dyninst to help map performance measurements back to source code, and to analyze execution traces to pinpoint, quantify and diagnose performance bottlenecks in parallel programs.</p>

									<p>The development of robust, adaptive software and algorithms that can fully exploit exascale capabilities and future computing architectures is critical to designing advanced materials and devices with targeted properties. We have developed an open-source code that discretizes the DFT equations on real-space grids that are distributed over the nodes of a massively parallel system via domain decomposition. Multigrid techniques are used to dramatically accelerate<br />convergence while only requiring nearest neighbor communications. The real-space multigrid (RMG) code achieves full plane wave accuracy and scales from desktops and clusters to supercomputers consisting of ~200k cores and 20k GPUs, including the Cray XE-XK systems and the new IBM-NVIDIA pre-exascale Summit. Multilevel parallelization with MPI, threads and/or Cuda/HIP programming enables adaptation to future exascale supercomputers. RMG is<br />distributed via www.rmgdft.org, with over 3,800 downloads to date. Advanced functionalities are provided through interfaces to other codes, including QMCPACK, BerkeleyGW, Phonopy, and ALAMODE.</p>

									<p>As heterogeneous computing (CPUs, GPUs etc.) and ,<br />networking (NVLinks, X-Bus etc.) hardware continue to<br />advance, it becomes increasingly essential and challenging<br />to understand the interactions between High-Performance<br />Computing (HPC) and Deep Learning applications/frameworks,<br />the communication middleware they rely on, the underlying<br />communication fabric these high-performance middlewares<br />depend on, and the schedulers that manage HPC clusters.<br />Such understanding will enable application developers/users,<br />system administrators, and middleware developers to maximize<br />the efficiency and performance of individual components that<br />comprise a modern HPC system and solve different grand<br />challenge problems.  Moreover, determining the root cause of<br />performance degradation is complex for the domain scientist.<br />The scale of emerging HPC clusters further exacerbates the<br />problem.

									<p>Molecular simulation plays an important role in many sub-fields of science and engineering.<br />Systems composed of soft matter are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but molecular simulations of such systems pose particular computational challenges since the differences in potential energy between distant configurations are on the same order as the thermal motion, requiring time and/or ensemble-averaged data to be collected over long simulation trajectories for property evaluation. Furthermore, performing a molecular simulation of a soft matter system involves multiple steps, which have traditionally been performed by researchers in a ``bespoke'' fashion. The result is that many soft matter simulations are not reproducible based on the information provided in a publication, and large-scale screening of soft materials systems is a formidable challenge. To address the issues of reproducibility and computational screening capability, we have been developing the Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) software suite. We also propose a set of principles to render molecular simulations Transparent, Reproducible, Usable by others, and Extensible (TRUE). While it is not required to use MoSDeF to create TRUE simulations, MoSDeF facilitates the publication and dissemination of TRUE simulations by automating many of the critical steps in performing molecular simulations, thus enhancing their reproducibility.</p>

		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			The 2020 NSF CSSI PI Meeting is an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the NSF CSSI PI Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Definition of Sexual Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person may be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.<br /><br />
				Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Other Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Discrimination:</dt>
			<dd>
				Discrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person's competence or suitability.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Retaliation:</dt>
			<dd>
				Retaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment.
			</dd>
			<dt>Reporting an Incident:</dt>
			<dd>
				Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported immediately to one of the five Organizing Committee Members. All complaints will be treated seriously and be investigated promptly. Confidentiality will be honored to the extent permitted as long as the rights of others are not compromised.  Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the 2018 NSF CSSI PI Meeting, to the notification of appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
			</dd>
